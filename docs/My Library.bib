Efforts to curb or stop hybridization are hampered in two ways. First, hybrid individuals are difficult to identify based solely on morphology. Second, managers need to effectively search 6000 km2 for the presence of coyotes and hybrids. We develop a noninvasive method to screen large geographical areas for coyotes and hybrids with maternal coyote ancestry by combining mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis of faeces (scat) and geographic information system (GIS) technology. This method was implemented on the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (1000 km2) in northeastern North Carolina. A total of 956 scats were collected in the spring of 2000 and 2001 and global positioning system (GPS) coordinates were recorded. Seventy-five percent of the scats were assigned to species and five coyote/hybrid scats were detected. Placement of scat location coordinates on a map of the experimental population area revealed that four of the coyote/hybrid scats were detected within the home ranges of sterilized hybrids. The other coyote/hybrid scat indicated the presence of a previously unknown individual. We suggest this method be expanded to include more of the experimental population area and be optimized for use with nuclear markers to improve detection of hybrid and back-crossed individuals.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores can impose spatial patterns on otherwise homogeneous vegetation, but how these patterns change through time is poorly understood. Domestic livestock pastures are model systems for studying how foraging behavior influences the development of coupled grazing and vegetation patterns. We sampled forage production and utilization by cattle along distance-from-water gradients to provide a snapshot of grazing and vegetation patterns, and then evaluated the ability of simulation models to qualitatively reproduce these patterns. In the field, forage production increased with distance from water, as expected, but utilization peaked at intermediate distances from water in two of three study areas. Likewise, simulations based on a variety of foraging strategies produced gradients in forage production and, after forage availability near water declined sufficiently, peaks in utilization at intermediate distances. Distance-from-water gradients thus represent cumulative but not necessarily present day gradients in grazing intensity. The model with a foraging strategy based on time minimization produced slightly more realistic patterns in forage abundance than a model based on energy maximization, although results were sensitive to the value of the threshold for rejecting sites of low forage biomass. However, all models produced implausible thresholds in grazing and forage distribution, suggesting that factors besides resource distribution influence herbivore distributions. Moreover, different foraging rules produced similar vegetation gradients, especially on point water source landscapes, illustrating the difficulty of inferring foraging processes from vegetation patterns.},

  abstract = {Management problems could cause rangeland degradation worldwide. Monitoring the seasonal variation of available forage may help to prevent vegetation from deterioration and help to ensure sustainable animal production. Therefore, seasonal variations in the amounts of available forage, and the contents of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and digestible dry matter (DDM) were monitored for two years via both ground sampling and Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI data at semi-arid Bozdag Rangelands, Turkey. Available forage significantly varied between 374.4 and 936.4 kg ha−1 through the season and all quality parameters showed significant seasonal variations. Available forage was estimated in strong accuracy only in dry season (r2 = 0.72, P ≤ 0.01), but the seasonal variations of CP, ADF, and DDM contents were estimated in moderate accuracy (r2 = 0.56, 0.40, 0.41 respectively) by the satellite-derived NDVI data. Free Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI values gave promising results for monitoring the forage quality of these semi-arid rangelands, but further research is needed to develop new vegetation indexes for considering woody tissues in vegetation, and higher resolution for greater monitoring accuracy. •The BLM Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) strategy recommends five principles for building multiscale monitoring programs: standardized methods and indicators; data management and stewardship; appropriate sample designs; remote sensing integration; and structured implementation. These principles guide monitoring across public lands.•We find the AIM principles are sound and worthy of consideration for design and adaptation of rangeland monitoring programs worldwide.•An emergent principle, standard workflows and analysis frameworks for using data, connects data to land management decision-making and empowers land managers.•The AIM principles inspire and provide opportunities for the rangeland management community to implement adaptive management. •Collection, interpretation, and application of use-based monitoring data across large landscapes is challenging given the inherent variability in growing conditions and field-based estimates.•We present several approaches on leveraging geospatial data and technology to cope with this variability including weather and climate data, satellite remote-sensing data and associated tools, as well as livestock GPS collars.•Field-based estimates also can be improved with more careful consideration of field methods and improved observer training and calibration.•Planning and co-implementing of use-based and long-term landscape monitoring can inform causes of declining or improving rangeland health and better inform adaptive management. Invasions of native plant communities by non-native species present major challenges for ecosystem management and conservation. Invasive annual grasses such as cheatgrass, medusahead, and ventenata are pervasive and continue to expand their distributions across imperiled sagebrush-steppe communities of the western United States. These invasive grasses alter native plant communities, ecosystem function, and fire regimes, threatening sagebrush ecosystem persistence. Spatial data describing the distribution and abundance of invasive species are often used by resource managers to identify, target, and determine needed interventions. However, there are challenges associated with translating these datasets into management actions. We conducted a review of available spatial products to assess advances in, and barriers to, applying contemporary model-based maps to support rangeland management. We found dozens of regional data products describing cheatgrass or annual herbaceous cover and few maps describing ventenata or medusahead. Over the past decade, IAG spatial data increased in spatial and temporal resolution and increasingly used response variables that indicate the severity of infestation such as percent cover. Despite improvements, use of such data is limited by the time required to find, compare, understand, and translate model-based maps into management strategy. There is also a need for products with higher spatial resolution and accuracy. In collaboration with a multipartner stakeholder group, we identified key considerations that guide selection of IAG spatial data products for use by land managers and other users. On the basis of these considerations, we discuss issues that contribute to a research-implementation gap between users and product developers and suggest future directions for improved development of management-ready spatial products. •Invasive annual grasses pose a widespread threat to western rangelands, and a strategic and proactive approach is needed to tackle this problem.•Oregon partners used new spatial data to develop a geographic strategy for management of invasive annual grasses at landscape scales across jurisdictional boundaries. The geographic strategy considers annual and perennial herbaceous cover along with site resilience and resistance in categorizing areas into intact core, transitioning, and degraded areas.•The geographic strategy provides 1) a conceptual framework for proactive management, building upon similar work recently begun across the Great Basin, and 2) multi-scale spatial products for both policymakers and local managers to identify strategic areas for investment of limited resources.•These spatial products can be used by Oregon partners to generate a shared vision of success, facilitate proactive management to “defend and grow the core,” and collaboratively develop meaningful and realistic goals and strategies for management of annual grasses at landscape scales.},

  abstract = {Individual prescription animal management will soon be possible by combining electronics and animal behaviour. Once a proper stocking rate has been established, controlling stocking density (SD) is a manager’s second greatest challenge. Of the multifaceted tools and techniques used to alter animal distribution, none offer the unique possibilities of virtual fencing (VF). VF combines Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and electro-mechanically produced bilateral cues in a new paradigm to control free-ranging animal location and direction of movement in a humane and reproducible manner in real-time. The only ground-based hardware is the device worn by the animal in which a central processing unit (CPU) uses radio frequency signals captured from GPS satellites to determine the animal’s location. A geographically referenced virtual boundary (VB) programmed into the unit’s Geographic Information System (GIS) is combined with GPS data to determine when a VB has been penetrated and at what angle. When this occurs, algorithms in the CPU determine to which side of the animal the fail-safe programmable repertoire of cues, having a range of intensities, is to be applied to encourage the animal to move away from the VB using the least intense cues and shortest route possible. Programming the VB to move or surround individual animals allows dispersal or gathering of animals autonomously. Proof-of-concept was established using a cow wearing a neck saddle prototype without producing undue stress as determined using heart rate measurements.},

  abstract = {Virtual fencing is a method of controlling animals without ground-based fencing. Control occurs by altering an animal’s behaviour through one or more sensory cues administered to the animal after it has attempted to penetrate an electronically-generated boundary. This boundary can be of any geometrical shape, and though unseen by the eye, is detected by a computer system worn by the animal. The most recent autonomous programmable systems use radio frequency (RF) signals, emanating from global positioning system (GPS) satellites to generate boundaries. Algorithms within a geographic information system (GIS) within the device’s computer use the GPS and other data to determine where on the animal a cue, or cues, should be applied and for how long. The first commercial virtual fencing system was patented in 1973 for controlling domestic dogs. Virtual fencing was used for the first time to control livestock in 1987. Since then proof-of-concept research using commercial, as well as custom designed systems have demonstrated that virtual fencing can successfully hold as well as move livestock over the landscape. Commercial virtual livestock control systems do not yet exist but research continues towards this goal. Pending research needs relating to this method of animal control are discussed in light of currently available technologies.},

  abstract = {Free-ranging livestock play a pivotal role globally in the conversion of plant tissue into products and services that support man’s many and changing lifestyles. With domestication came the task of providing livestock with an adequate plane of nutrition while simultaneously managing vegetation for sustainable production. Attempting to meld these two seemingly opposing management goals continues to be a major focus of rangeland research. Demand for multiple goods and services from rangelands today requires that livestock production make the smallest possible ‘negative hoof-print’. Advancements in global navigation satellite system, geographic information systems, and electronic/computing technologies, coupled with improved understanding of animal behaviour, positions virtual fencing (VF) as an increasingly attractive option for managing free-ranging livestock. VF offers an alternative to conventional fencing by replacing physical barriers with sensory cues to control an animal’s forward movement. Currently, audio and electrical stimulation are the cues employed. When VF becomes a commercial reality, manual labour will be replaced in large part with cognitive labour for real-time prescription-based livestock distribution management that is robust, accurate, precise and flexible. The goal is to manage rangeland ecosystems optimally for soils, plants, herbivores in addition to the plant and animal’s microflora. However, maximising the benefits of VF will require a paradigm shift in management by using VF as a ‘virtual herder’ rather than simply as a tool to manage livestock within static physical barriers.},

Time spent grazing ranged from 4.1 to 16.0 h in horses, from 2.3 to 12.7 h in cattle and 4.4 to 10.6 h in sheep. Time spent feeding (grazing + eating supplements) was strongly negatively correlated with time spent standing in horses and cattle, but only weakly so in sheep. Grazing times in winter-spring varied with pasture availability in cattle and horses, but not in sheep. Horses achieved long grazing times by grazing extensively at night, whereas sheep and cattle achieved them by intensifying their grazing during morning and afternoon grazing periods. Horses spent very little time lying down (1.1 h), whereas sheep and cattle averaged 11.6 and 10.5 h, respectively. The circadian patterns of activity were generally similar in sheep and cattle on most days; on a few others they were quite dissimilar. Those of horses were usually quite different f from those of either sheep or cattle.},

Using three pairs of pastures stocked at moderate (0.6 animal unit months \&lsqb;AUM]{$\mkern1mu$}·{$\mkern1mu$}ha-1) versus very heavy (1.2 AUM{$\mkern1mu$}·{$\mkern1mu$}ha-1) rates, we detected greater bare soil under very heavy (mean{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}22.5\%) versus moderate stocking (mean{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}13.5\%; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.053) and a lower coefficient of variation across pastures under very heavy (0.48) versus moderate stocking (0.75; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.032). Bare soil exhibited significant positive spatial autocorrelation across distances of 60–120~m under moderate stocking (Moran's I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.14), while patchiness at this scale was eliminated under very heavy grazing (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}-0.05). Across distances of 120–480~m, we observed no spatial autocorrelation with either stocking rate. Spatial autocorrelation was greatest at a separation distance of 2~m (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.48–0.58) but was unaffected by stocking rate at this scale. Thus, very heavy grazing did not increase spatial autocorrelation in bare soil across scales of 2–480~m. Means and variability in the distribution of bare soil were not influenced by ecological site. Bare soil increased primarily at the scale of individual plant clusters through both increases in the density of small (2–20~cm) bare patch intercepts and increases in the frequency of bare patch intercepts of 20–60~cm (rather than \&spilt;{$\mkern1mu$}20~cm). Our approach demonstrates the utility of VLSA for analyzing interactions between grazing and other landscape features and highlights the importance of spatially explicit sampling across broad scales (pastures) while testing for potential shifts in patchiness of bare soil at the scale of plant interspaces.

Usando tres pares de pastizales con carga animal moderada (0.6 unidades animal por mes \&lsqb;AUM]{$\mkern1mu$}·{$\mkern1mu$}ha-1) comparándolos contra pastizales con cargas animales altas (1.2 AUM{$\mkern1mu$}·{$\mkern1mu$}ha-1), detectamos una mayor cantidad de suelo desnudo en lugares con cargas animales altas (media{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}22.5\%) en comparación con las cargas animales moderadas (mean{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}13.5\%; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.053), y un bajo coeficiente de variación a través de pastizales con cargas animales muy altas (0.48) en comparación con cargas animales moderadas (0.75; P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.032). El suelo desnudo presentó auto-correlaciones significativas y positivas espaciales en las distancia de 60 a 120~m bajo una carga animal moderada (Moran's I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.14), mientras, la agregación a esta escala se eliminó dentro de áreas de carga animal alta (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}-0.05). A la escala de 120–480~m, no observamos correlación alguna con ninguna carga animal. La auto correlación espacial fue la mayor en la separación de 2~m (I{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.48–0.58) pero no fue afectada por ningún nivel de carga animal en esta escala. De esta manera los lugares pastoreados fuertemente no incrementaron la auto correlación espacial en suelo desnudo en la escala de 2–480~m. Las medias y la variabilidad en la distribución de suelo desnudo no fueron influenciadas por los sitios ecológicos. El suelo desnudo se incrementó principalmente en las escalas de plantas individuales y agregados, ambas mediante el incremento en la densidad de pequeñas intercepciones de suelo desnudo (2–20~cm), e incrementos en la frecuencia de intercepciones de suelo desnudo de 20 a 60~m (en lugar de \&spilt;{$\mkern1mu$}20~cm). Nuestro enfoque demuestra la utilidad de VLSA para analizar interacciones entre el pastoreo y otras características del paisaje, y recalca la importancia del muestreo espacialmente explicito a través de amplias escalas (pastizales) mientras se evalúa el potencial de cambio de áreas a suelo desnudo a la escala de espacios entre plantas.},

  abstract = {Livestock-w­ ildlife interactions in rangelands are often viewed in terms of competition, but livestock and native ungulates can also benefit each other through long-­ term modifications of rangeland habitats. Here we synthesize research on rangelands in central Laikipia focusing on two types of cattle-­wildlife interactions that have implications for their long-­term coexistence. The first interaction occurs via redistribution of soil nutrients within the ecosystem, which is a consequence of the use of bomas (temporary corrals) to manage livestock. Our studies on two different soil types show that rotational boma management creates hectare-s­ cale patches in the landscape that are enriched in soil and plant nutrients and persist for decades to centuries. In both of the predominant soil types in Laikipia, forage phosphorus content is low relative to ungulate demands during peak lactation. Nutrient-r­ich boma sites (hereafter referred to as glades) provide a key wet-s­eason forage resource of nutritional sufficiency for lactation. Our studies further show that a wide range of native ungulates selectively use glades relative to surrounding nutrient-p­ oor habitats. Impala (Aepyceros melampus) in particular show intensive use of glades on sandy soils and are rare in portions of the landscape lacking glades. A second important pathway for cattle-w­ ildlife interaction occurs through the influence of native browsing ungulates on woody vegetation. Shrub and tree cover has been increasing in Laikipia over the past century, followed by increases in native browsers in recent decades on ranches where wildlife are allowed to coexist with cattle. Our exclosure experiments in central Laikipia indicate that native browsers suppress shrub encroachment on both dominant soil types. However, the strength of browser effects are three to seven times greater on sandy soils, where two browsers, dik-­dik and elephants, are both abundant, compared to heavy clay soils, where elephants are the only dominant browser. In the clay soils, native browsers still exert a significant influence on dynamics of the dominant tree, Acacia drepanolobium, and suppress encroachment by subdominant shrub species. Browser effects on woody vegetation likely enhance forage production for cattle and maintain open habitats favored by native grazers for predator avoidance. Taken together, our studies indicate that boma rotation and browser control of shrub encroachment are key interaction pathways that promote cattle-w­ ildlife coexistence in the Ewaso ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Application of existing and novel management techniques can alter traditional livestock grazing patterns and significantly improve the sustainability of arid rangelands. Livestock often congregate and heavily graze riparian areas and other sensitive rangeland, while abundant forage remains in other areas. Increasing the uniformity of grazing can help protect fisheries, wildlife habitat, and other vegetative and watershed resources. For years, managers have improved grazing distribution in extensive arid pastures by developing new water sources. In addition, strategic supplement placement can be used to lure cattle to graze areas that typically receive little use. Placement of lowmoisture molasses blocks in steeper areas that were far from water increased forage use by 14\% at distances up to 600 m from supplement in foothill rangeland. Recent research has examined the potential of breed and individual animal selection to improve grazing distribution patterns. Cattle breeds developed in mountainous terrain utilize rugged rangeland more uniformly than breeds developed in more gentle terrain.},

Real-time tracking and accelerometer monitoring has the potential to remotely detect livestock disease, animal well-being and grazing distribution issues and notify ranchers and graziers so that they can respond as soon as possible. On-going research has shown that accelerometers can remotely monitor livestock behavior and detect activity changes that are associated with disease and parturition. GPS tracking can also detect parturition by monitoring the distance between a ewe and the remainder of the flock. Tracking also has the potential to detect water system failures. Combinations of GPS tracking and accelerometer monitoring may be more accurate than either device used by itself. Real-time GPS tracking can identify when livestock congregate in environmental sensitive areas which may allow managers the chance to respond before resource degradation occurs. Identification of genetic markers associated with terrain use, decreased cost of GPS tracking and novel tracking data processing should facilitate development of tools needed for genetic selection for cattle grazing distribution. Precision livestock management has potential to improve welfare of livestock grazing rangelands and forested lands, reduce labor costs and improve ranch profitability and improve the condition and sustainability of riparian areas and other environmental sensitive areas on grazing lands around the world.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Over the last 20 yr, global positioning system (GPS) collars have greatly enhanced livestock grazing behavior research. Practices designed to improve livestock grazing distribution can now be accurately and cost effectively monitored with GPS tracking. For example, cattle use of feed supplement placed in areas far from water and on steep slopes can be measured with GPS tracking and corresponding impacts on distribution patterns estimated. Ongoing research has identified genetic markers that are associated with cattle spatial movement patterns. If the results can be validated, genetic selection for grazing distribution may become feasible. Tracking collars have become easier to develop and construct, making them significantly less expensive, which will likely increase their use in livestock grazing management research. Some research questions can be designed so that dependent variables are measured by spatial movements of livestock, and in such cases, GPS tracking is a practical tool for conducting studies on extensive and rugged rangeland pastures. Similarly, accelerometers are changing our ability to monitor livestock behavior. Today, accelerometers are sensitive and can record movements at fine temporal scales for periods of weeks to months. The combination of GPS tracking and accelerometers appears to be useful tools for identifying changes in livestock behavior that are associated with livestock diseases and other welfare concerns. Recent technological advancements may make real-time or near real-time tracking on rangelands feasible and cost-effective. This would allow development of applications that could remotely monitor livestock well-being on extensive rangeland and notify ranchers when animals require treatment or other management.},

  abstract = {We evaluated elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), cattle (Bos taurus), and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) diet composition, diet overlap, and forage selection on aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux)–sagebrush (Artemisia spp. L.) summer range in northeastern Nevada to understand potential for forage competition to provide better information for managing these communities. Diets were determined through microhistological fecal analysis from 1998 to 2000, and forage selection was evaluated at feeding sites in aspen and sagebrush communities in 1999 and 2000. Elk spring diets were the most diverse in composition; summer elk diets were dominated by forbs (59\%–78\%); deer consumed mostly woody browse (64\%–72\%); and cattle and sheep ate mostly graminoids. Lupines (Lupinus spp. L.) constituted\,≥\,11\% of elk, deer, and sheep diets in summer. Spurred lupine (Lupinus caudatus Kellogg) was the lupine typically selected in feeding sites and greatest consumption occurred in summer when total alkaloid levels were lowest. Highest diet overlap was between cattle and sheep in 1999 (68\%) and lowest between deer and cattle in 2000 (3\%). Summer elk and deer diets overlapped moderately (45\%–59\%). Diets did not differ between elk in spring with sheep, elk in summer with deer and sheep, or cattle with sheep. Cattle foraged selectively on forbs in aspen communities (68\%) and on graminoids in sagebrush communities (88\%), reflecting relative forage availabilities. We detected no differences among elk, cattle, and sheep for forage selection in aspen communities. Electivity indices indicated elk preferred forbs in aspen and sagebrush communities; cattle preferred graminoids in sagebrush; and foraging sheep preferred forbs in aspen. Our results suggest potential for forage competition among ungulates on aspen–sagebrush summer range is highest for forbs in aspen communities. Monitoring productivity and use of key forage species, particularly forbs in aspen communities, should complement management objectives on shared aspen–sagebrush summer range. Resumen Las Comunidades de Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) y Sagebrush (Artemisia spp. L.) Son importantes fuentes de forraje par los ungulados que habitan muchos de los pastizales de verano del oeste; sin embargo, la información sobre la competencia potencial por el forraje en estas comunidades es limitada. Con el propósito de entender la competencia potencial por el forraje y suministrar mejor información para el manejo de estas comunidades vegetales evaluamos la composición y similitud de la dieta y la selección de forraje del alce (Cervus elaphus), venado (Odocoileus hemionus), bovinos (Bos taurus) y ovinos (Ovis aries) apacentando un pastizal de verano de aspen–sagebrush del nordeste de Nevada. La dietas se determinaron mediante análisis microhistológico de heces fecales de 1998 al 2000 y en 1999 y 2000 se evaluó la selección de forraje en los sitios de alimentación de las comunidades de aspen y sagebrush. Las dietas del alce en primavera fueron las más diversas en composición, y en verano, su dieta estuvo dominada por hierbas (59\%–78\%); el venado consumió principalmente especies leñosas (64\%–72\%) y los bovinos y ovinos comieron principalmente gramíneas. Los lupinos (Lupinus spp. L.) constituyeron\,≥\,11\% de la dieta de verano del alce, venado y ovinos. El “Spurred lupine” (Lupinus caudatus Kellogg) fue el “Lupino” típicamente seleccionado por los ungulados en los sitios de alimentación y el mayor consumo ocurrió en verano cuando los niveles totales de alcaloides fueron los más bajos. La mayor similitud de la dieta se registró en 1999 entre los bovinos y ovinos (68\%) y el menor entre el venado y los bovinos en el 2000 (3\%). En verano, las dietas del alce y el venado se traslaparon moderadamente (45\%–59\%). En primavera la dieta del alce y los ovinos no difirió, lo mismo ocurrió en verano con la dieta del alce, el venado y los ovinos y la dieta de los bovinos y ovinos. Los bovinos apacentaron selectivamente las hierbas en las comunidades de aspen (68\%) y en las gramíneas en las comunidades de sagebrush (88\%), reflejando disponibilidades relativas de forraje. En las comunidades de aspen no detectamos diferencias entre el alce, bovinos y ovinos en la selectividad de forraje. Los índices de selectividad indicaron que el alce prefirió las hierbas en las comunidades de aspen–sagebrush; el ganado prefirió las gramineas en la comunidad de sagebrush y los ovinos prefirieron las hierbas cuando apacentaron en las comunidades de Aspen. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la competencia potencial por el forraje entre los ungulados en los pastizales de verano de aspen–sagebrush es mayor para las hierbas en las comunidades de aspen. El monitoreo de la productividad y el uso de las especies forrajeras clave, particularmente en las comunidades de aspen, debe ser un objetivo de manejo obligado en los pastizales de verano compartidos de aspen–sagebrush.},

  abstract = {To date, management and research on feral horses have been strongly influenced by concerns and priorities of the general public. Due to outcry from numerous interest groups, research and management of feral horses have tended to be autecological, focused on individuals rather than populations, and addressing potential competition between horses and cattle, thus largely ignoring questions addressing roles that feral horses may play in arid and semiarid ecosystems. Management can never satisfy all desires of all interest groups, and research rarely can give answers so definitive that further questions will not arise. However, as we attempt to demonstrate, both management and research can help shape and inform public opinion through numerous means. Because feral horses have been one of the most contentious management issues of the last 100 years, it is critical that managers and investigators address both immediate and long-term concerns in their work. Honest communication of results and associated levels of uncertainty, along with rigorous testing of alternative explanations, are essential in issues having high levels of sociopolitical interest. Continued use of relevant, well-planned investigations in concert with thoughtful management may help define the future role the feral horse will play as "an integral part of the system of public lands" in the western United States.},

  abstract = {Introduced species can have important effects on the component species and processes of native ecosystems. However, effective introduced species management can be complicated by technical and social challenges. We identify “social–ecological mismatches” (that is, differences between the scales and functioning of interacting social and ecological systems) as one such challenge. We present three case studies in which mismatches between the organization and functioning of key social and ecological systems have contributed to controversies and debates surrounding introduced species management and policy. We identify three common issues: social systems and cultures may adapt to a new species’ arrival at a different rate than ecosystems; ecological impacts can arise at one spatial scale while social impacts occur at another; and the effects of introduced species can spread widely, whereas management actions are constrained by organizational and/or political boundaries.

  abstract = {The inadaptability of the frightening devices to the behavioral-change exhibited by grazing animals has been a great challenge in developing animal detection and recognition system that can prevent animal intrusion to a prohibited area. Animal distribution is something that is challenging and that does not have an immediate answer to. In fact, literature shows that just in the last few years, more than 68 different strategies have been used trying to affect animal distribution. These include putting a fence in, developing drinking water in a new location, putting supplemental feed at different locations, changing the times feed is put out, putting in artificial shade so that animals would move to that location, using identification means such as ear tags, radio frequency identification, tattooing, marking, branding, and biometrics. There are a host of frightening strategies that have been used to scare animals from intruding prohibited area; these include installing frightening devices such as explosive materials, acoustics and bioacoustics gadgets, and so on. Moreover, they all work under certain conditions; some of them work even better when they are used synergistically. Sooner or later, these animals become accustomed to most of the frightening techniques put in place to prevent them from going beyond their boundaries or intruding the prohibited area. Virtual fencing (VF) and global positioning system (GPS) are the recent technology developed to handle the challenges that come with animal grazing behavior. Recent advances in GPS and VF technology have allowed the development of free-range and lightweight GPS collar tools suitable for monitoring animal behavioral changes.},

We used meta-analyses to study the effects of infrastructure proximity on mammal and bird populations. Data were gathered from 49 studies on 234 mammal and bird species. The main response by mammals and birds in the vicinity of infrastructure was either avoidance or a reduced population density. The mean species abundance, relative to non-disturbed distances (MSA), was used as the effect size measure. The impact of infrastructure distance on MSA was studied using meta-analyses. Possible sources of heterogeneity in the results of the meta-analysis were explored with meta-regression. Mammal and bird population densities declined with their proximity to infrastructure. The effect of infrastructure on bird populations extended over distances up to about 1km, and for mammal populations up to about 5km. Mammals and birds seemed to avoid infrastructure in open areas over larger distances compared to forested areas, which could be related to the reduced visibility of the infrastructure in forested areas. We did not find a significant effect of traffic intensity on the MSA of birds. Species varied in their response to infrastructure. Raptors were found to be more abundant in the proximity of infrastructure whereas other bird taxa tended to avoid it. Abundances were affected at variable distances from infrastructure: within a few meters for small-sized mammals and up to several hundred meters for large-sized mammals. Our findings show the importance of minimizing infrastructure development for wildlife conservation in relatively undisturbed areas. By combining actual species distributions with the effect distance functions we developed, regions sensitive to infrastructure development may be identified. Additionally, the effect distance functions can be used in models in support of decision making on infrastructure planning.},

Observational and experimental data were contrasted for six populations of bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, living in heterogeneous environments with natural predators at Great Basin (N=4), Sonoran Desert (N=1) and northern prairie (N=1) study sites. Manipulations included the alteration of dietary protein (via alfalfa supplements) in habitats that varied in predation risk when females were at different stages of pregnancy and, hence, protein requirements. Both sexes left the mountainous terrain during late winter to feed on bajadas where emergent new grasses were highest in crude protein. In these areas females were more than twice as likely as males to flee from natural predators. Females also (1) remained closer to mountainous slopes while feeding and (2) incurred greater losses in feeding time when away from slopes than males. These data suggest that predation pressure affects the sexes differently. Results of the experimental manipulations were consistent with the posed hypothesis since protein supplements on bajadas were consumed by both sexes until emergent new grasses became more abundant on mountainous slopes. However, natural variation in female reproductive status allowed a further refinement of the extent to which pregnancy incentives and predation constraints affected habitat use. Ewes not accompanied by lambs or yearlings used areas where they were at risk from predators, such as bajadas, more frequently than those without young, observations that favour the tenet that potential predation pressure overrides increased nutrient demands during late stages of pregnancy. These data suggest that species of mammals with access to heterogeneous environments prior to parturition are ideal subjects in which to examine the extent to which habitat shifts result from balancing increased dietary requirements during late gestation and safety from potential predators.},

  abstract = {The reintroduction of the Mexican gray wolf to the southwest U.S. has been controversial because of documented wolf-livestock conflict (and fear of potential conflicts). Wolf-livestock interactions can lead to economic losses for ranchers directly from depredation and indirectly through physiological impacts on livestock such as weight loss. Ranchers report that, in addition to economic losses, they face additional management costs due to the presence of wolves. Relying on a survey of Arizona ranchers, this study explores ranchers’ attitudes toward wolf reintroduction, identifies and estimates the costs of management practices implemented by ranchers to avoid or reduce wolf-livestock conflicts, and examines how spending on preventative management practices, including the value of ranchers’ time, compares with net returns per cow under three different price scenarios: a low-price, mid-price, and high-price year. Building upon literature that finds ranchers are motivated by lifestyle and other non-monetary benefits of ranching, we posit that factors beyond profit maximization influence ranchers’ decision to implement management practices to limit wolf-livestock conflicts. We find that spending on preventive management practices can be large relative to net returns. We also find that negative attitudes toward wolves are not well correlated with experiences with or losses from wolf depredation. These results illuminate the complexity of rancher attitudes and management decisions, with implications for predator coexistence and conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Managing livestock movement in extensive systems has environmental and production benefits. Currently permanent wire fencing is used to control cattle; this is both expensive and inflexible. Cattle are known to respond to auditory and visual cues and we investigated whether these can be used to manipulate their behaviour. Twenty-five Belmont Red steers with a mean live weight of 270 kg were each randomly assigned to one of five treatments. Treatments consisted of a combination of cues (audio, tactile and visual stimuli) and consequence (electrical stimulation). The treatments were electrical stimulation alone, audio plus electrical stimulation, vibration plus electrical stimulation, light plus electrical stimulation and electrified electric fence (6 kV) plus electrical stimulation. Cue stimuli were administered for 3 s followed immediately by electrical stimulation (consequence) of 1 kV for 1 s. The experiment tested the operational efficacy of an on-animal control or virtual fencing system. A collar–halter device was designed to carry the electronics, batteries and equipment providing the stimuli, including audio, vibration, light and electrical of a prototype virtual fencing device. Cattle were allowed to travel along a 40 m alley to a group of peers and feed while their rate of travel and response to the stimuli were recorded. The prototype virtual fencing system was successful in modifying the behaviour of the cattle. The rate of travel of cattle along the alley demonstrated the large variability in behavioural response associated with tactile, visual and audible cues. The experiment demonstrated virtual fencing has potential for controlling cattle in extensive grazing systems. However, larger numbers of cattle need to be tested to derive a better understanding of the behavioural variance. Further controlled experimental work is also necessary to quantify the interaction between cues, consequences and cattle learning.},

  abstract = {This study evaluated patterns and drivers of vegetation change in a semi-arid grassland in southern Arizona across eleven years of extended drought and high temperatures, 2004–2014. Changes included declines in C4 perennial grass basal cover with patchy grass mortality, leaf litter increases, shrub declines, and increases in non-native grass Eragrostis lehmanniana. Linear mixed-effects models identified precipitation during January–June “extended spring” as the best predictor of grass basal cover, especially when plots were grouped by soil and topographic features. Models showed that a decrease in extended spring precipitation from 150 to 50~mm was associated with loss of one-quarter to one-half of plots' total grass cover. Association of grass declines with this novel season of drought is especially relevant because global circulation models predict steep declines in spring rainfall. Increasing E.~lehmanniana dominance was also associated with native grass declines. There was little support over this time for predicted effects of livestock grazing or shrub encroachment. This study demonstrated how monitoring data from working landscapes can improve ecological understanding of drought. Findings also suggest managers could improve chances for sustaining resilience by responding to rainfall in multiple seasons, monitoring for mortality events, and establishing contingency plans for various types of drought.},

  abstract = {Ground cover is a key indicator of rangeland condition and influences rangeland management decisions, yet there have been few advances in ground-cover measurement methods. The advent of digital photography and automated image processing promise a revolution in the way ground cover is measured. To assess the potential for automation we compared conventional and automated methods for measuring ground cover against known artificial populations. The known populations were created from 20 nadir images of a Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young) vegetation type acquired with a 5-megapixel Olympus E20 digital single lens reflex camera mounted on an aluminum camera frame at 2m above ground level. The images were converted to color, 2-dimensional images that no longer represented real-world conditions but had known cover values and conserved a simplified form of the pattern and spatial context of the plant community. These images were then printed at 1:1 scale to a 1 × 1-m poster. Posters were evaluated for color cover under laboratory conditions using the conventional techniques of steel-point frame, laser-point frame, line-point intercept, ocular estimation, and line intercept. Photographs of the posters were measured for color cover using standard and custom-created algorithms within the VegMeasure image analysis framework, and using the Digital Grid Overlay method. Results indicate that conventional techniques had significantly greater correlation (≥ 92\% agreement of measured to known) than measurements from the algorithms used in the VegMeasure analysis (70\%). The critical factor influencing accuracy of point-sampling methods was the area of the contact point for the given method. These findings provide an important measure of relative accuracy among methods for land managers and for researchers seeking to improve rangeland monitoring methods. Resumen La cobertura basal es un indicador clave de la condición del pastizal e influye en las decisiones de manejo del pastizal; sin embargo, ha habido pocos avances en los métodos de medición de la cobertura basal. El advenimiento de la fotografía digital y el procesamiento automático de imágenes promete un revolución en la forma en la que la cobertura basal es medida. Pare evaluar el potencial de automatización, comparamos métodos convencionales y automatizados para medir la cobertura basal, la comparación se realizó en poblaciones artificiales de cobertura conocida. Las poblaciones artificiales fueron creadas a partir de 20 imágenes de baja altura de un tipo de vegetación de “Wyoming big sagebrush” (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young) tomadas con una cámara digital Olympus E20 de 5 megapixeles con lente reflex simple montada en un marco de aluminio a dos metros de altura del nivel del suelo. Las imágenes se convirtieron a color y en imágenes de dos dimensiones que ya no representaban el mundo real, pero tenían valores conocidos de cobertura y conservaron una forma simplificada del patrón y contexto espacial de la comunidad vegetal. Posteriormente estas imágenes fueron impresas en una escala de 1:1 en un poster de 1 × 1m. Los posters fueron evaluados bajo condiciones de laboratorio para determinar la cobertura por clase de color, para ello se usaron las siguientes técnicas convencionales: marco de puntos de acero, marco de puntos láser, línea de intercepción de puntos, estimación ocular, y la línea de intercepción. Así mismo, la cobertura por clase de color de los posters se midió usando algoritmos estándar y especiales dentro del protocolo de análisis de imágenes VegMeasure y usando el método de la capa de malla digital. Los resultados indican que las técnicas convencionales tuvieron una correlación significativamente mayor (≥ 92\% de concordancia de lo medido con lo conocido) que las mediciones de cobertura derivadas de los algoritmos usados en el análisis de VegMeasure (70\%). El factor critico que influenció la exactitud de los métodos de muestreo de puntos fue el área de contacto del punto. Estos hallazgos proveen una medida importante de la exactitud relativa entre los métodos evaluados la cual es de utilidad para los manejadores de pastizales e investigadores que buscan mejorar los métodos de monitoreo de los pastizales.},

Remote sensing provides an effective tool for rapidly and accurately assessing rangeland vegetation and other surface attributes such as bare soil and rock. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of remote sensing as a surrogate for field-based sampling techniques in detecting ground cover features (i.e., trees, shrubs, herbaceous cover, litter, surface), and comparing results with field-based measurements collected by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources Range Trent Program. In the field, five 152 m long transects were used to sample plant, litter, rock, and bare-ground cover using the Daubenmire ocular estimate method. At the same location of each field plot, a 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), 25 cm pixel resolution, remotely sensed image was taken from a fixed-wing aircraft. Each image was spectrally classified producing 4 cover classes (tree, shrub, herbaceous, surface). No significant differences were detected between canopy cover collected remotely and in the field for tree (P = 0.652), shrub (P = 0.800), and herbaceous vegetation (P = 0.258). Surface cover was higher in field plots (P {$<$} 0.001), likely in response to the methods used to sample surface features by field crews. Accurately classifying vegetation and other features from remote sensed information can improve the efficiency of collecting vegetation and surface data. This information can also be used to improve data collection frequency for rangeland monitoring and to efficiently quantify ecological succession patterns.},

The managers of these lands must, in addition to considering the value of timber harvests, consider various nonmarket amenity services, such as recreation, water flow, and wildlife, which are influenced by alterations in the standing stocks of timber. The chapter discusses research results on the relation of such multiple-use management to single-purpose timber management. The presentation is motivated by a number of issues of current concern, including (1) the withdrawal of lands from timber management, (2) the specialization or diversification of land use, (3) the level and stability of timber supply, and (4) the wisdom of certain accepted rule-of-thumb principles of public forestland management related to the age and level of harvests. The principles of public forestry in the United States have often been driven by the fear of timber shortage and the destabilizing effects on employment and prices arising from fluctuations in the supply of timber. The chapter describes the institutional setting for multiple-use management within the U.S. Forest Service.},

  abstract = {Management of rangelands, and natural resources in general, has become increasingly complex. There is an atmosphere of increasing expectations for conservation efforts associated with a variety of issues from water quality to endangered species. We argue that many current issues are complex by their nature, which influences how we approach them. We define a complex problem as one that varies in time and space. In other words, one answer may not be correct for all sites or during all years. For simple problems a generalized answer may be sufficient, and even for complex problems, general rules provide a good starting point. However, we suggest that it is important to distinguish between simple and complex problems. Several key obstacles emerge when considering complex natural resource problems, namely, 1) no single entity can handle all aspects of the problem and 2) significant knowledge gaps exist and will continue to exist into the future. We suggest that overcoming these obstacles will benefit from 1) a framework for effective partnerships and 2) a mechanism for continuous learning. Managing complex problems will require some combination of the following: 1) a process-based understanding of the problem (i.e., what causes variation in time and space), 2) adaptive management, and 3) effective coordination of research and management. There are many examples of organizations applying portions of these approaches to complex problems; however, it seems that in many cases the process has simply evolved in that direction rather than being a planned strategy. We suggest that as a profession we need to have a discussion about the nature of the problems we are addressing and how researchers and managers can jointly address these problems. Resumen El manejo de pastizales naturales, y de los recursos naturales en general, se ha tornado cada vez más complejo. Existe un ambiente de expectativas crecientes en cuanto a los esfuerzos de conservación asociados con una variedad de temáticas que abarcan desde la calidad del agua hasta especies en peligro de extinción. Sostenemos que mucha de la problemática actual es intrínsecamente compleja, y que dicha complejidad incide en el modo en que abordamos esta problemática. Definimos un problema complejo como aquel que varía a través del tiempo y el espacio. Es decir que una respuesta podría no ser la solución correcta para todos los sitios ni para todos los años. Las respuestas generales son casi siempre suficientes para la resolución de problemas sencillos, y aún el caso de problemas complejos, las reglas generales constituyen un buen punto de partida. No obstante, sugerimos que es importante distinguir entre problemas sencillos y complejos. Existen varios obstáculos clave que emergen cuando se consideran problemas complejos asociados con los recursos naturales: 1) ninguna entidad por si sola puede abordar todos los aspectos de un problema y 2) existen vacíos de conocimiento considerables que continuarán existiendo en el futuro. Proponemos que sortear estos obstáculos producirá como beneficios: 1) un marco para la generación de asociaciones efectivas y 2) un mecanismo para el aprendizaje continuo. El manejo de problemas complejos requerirá una combinación de los siguientes factores: 1) una comprensión del problema basado en procesos (es decir, qué es lo que genera la variación en el tiempo y el espacio), 2) manejo adaptativo, y 3) coordinación efectiva entre actividades de investigación y manejo. Existen muchos ejemplos de organizaciones que aplican porciones de estos enfoques para la resolución de problemas complejos, sin embargo, en muchos casos parecería que el proceso ha evolucionado en esta dirección sin mediar una estrategia planificada. Proponemos que como profesión debemos tener una discusión sobre la naturaleza de los problemas que estamos abordando y sobre el modo en que los sectores de investigación y manejo pueden abordar dichos problemas conjuntamente.},

  abstract = {In this study, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a quick and safe method for monitoring biotic resources was evaluated. Vegetation cover and the amount of bare ground are important factors in understanding the sustainability of many ecosystems. Methods that improve speed and cost efficiency could greatly improve how biotic resources are monitored on western lands. Sagebrush steppe ecosystems provide important habitat for a variety of species including sage grouse and pygmy rabbit. Improved methods of monitoring these habitats are needed because not enough resource specialists or funds are available for comprehensive on-the-ground evaluations. In this project, two UAV platforms, fixed-wing and helicopter, were used to collect still-frame imagery to assess vegetation cover in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This paper discusses the process for collecting and analyzing imagery from the UAVs to 1) estimate percentage of cover for six different vegetation types (shrub, dead shrub, grass, forb, litter, and bare ground) and 2) locate sage grouse using representative decoys. The field plots were located on the Idaho National Laboratory site west of Idaho Falls, Idaho, in areas with varying amounts and types of vegetation cover. A software program called SamplePoint was used along with visual inspection to evaluate percentage of cover for the six cover types. Results were compared against standard field measurements to assess accuracy. The comparison of fixed-wing and helicopter UAV technology against field estimates shows good agreement for the measurement of bare ground. This study shows that if a high degree of detail and data accuracy is desired, then a helicopter UAV may be a good platform to use. If the data collection objective is to assess broad-scale landscape level changes, then the collection of imagery with a fixed-wing system is probably more appropriate. Resumen En este estudio se evaluó el uso de vehículos aéreos no tripulados (VANT) como un método rápido y seguro para monitorear recursos bióticos. La cubierta vegetal y la cantidad de suelo desnudo son factores importantes para entender la sustentabilidad de varios ecosistemas. Métodos que mejoren la rapidez y el costo podrían mejorar la manera en que los recursos bióticos de las tierras del oeste son monitoreados. El ecosistema de estepa de artemisa provee hábitat para varias especies que incluyen al ganso sage y conejo pigmeo. Es necesario mejorar los métodos de monitoreo de estos hábitat porque no hay suficientes especialistas en recursos o fondos disponibles para evaluaciones completas en el terreno. En este proyecto, se utilizaron dos plataformas de VANT, alas fijas y helicóptero para recolectar imágenes fotográficas para evaluar la cubierta vegetal en un ecosistema de estepa de artemisa. En este artículo se discute el proceso de recolección y análisis de imágenes de un VANT para 1) estimar el porcentaje de cubierta de seis diferentes tipos de vegetación (matorral, matorral seco, zacate, hierbas, mantillo y suelo desnudo) y 2) ubicar gansos sage usando señuelos. Las parcelas experimentales se ubicaron en el Laboratorio Nacional de Idaho sitio localizado en Idaho Falls, Idaho en áreas con diferentes cantidades y tipos de cubierta vegetal. Se uso el programa de software SamplePoint junto con inspecciones oculares para evaluar el porcentaje de cubierta de seis tipos de cubiertas. Los resultados se compararon contra medidas de campo estándar para evaluar su precisión. La comparación de la tecnología de helicóptero VANT y alas fijas contra estimaciones de campo muestra buena relación para las medidas de suelo desnudo. El estudio muestra que sí se requiere alto grado de detalle y precisión en los datos el helicóptero VANT podría ser una buena plataforma para usarse. Pero sí el objetivo de recopilación de datos, es evaluar a gran escala los niveles de cambio en el paisaje entonces, la recopilación de imágenes con el sistema de alas fijas es probablemente más apropiado.},

  abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS)-based virtual fences offer the potential to improve the management of grazing animals. Prototype collar devices utilising patented virtual fencing algorithms were placed on six Angus heifers in a 6.15 hectare paddock. After a “no fence” period, sequential, shifting virtual fences restricted the animals to 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% of the paddock area widthways and 50\% lengthways across 22 days. Audio cues signaled the virtual boundary, and were paired with electrical stimuli if the animals continued forward into the boundary. Within approximately 48 h, the cattle learned the 40\% fence and were henceforth restricted to the subsequent inclusion zones a minimum of 96.70\% (±standard error 0.01\%) of the time. Over time, the animals increasingly stayed within the inclusion zones using audio cues alone, and on average, approached the new fence within 4.25 h. The animals were thus attentive to the audio cue, not the fence location. The time spent standing and lying and the number of steps were similar between inclusion zones (all p ≥ 0.42). More lying bouts occurred at the 80\% and lengthways inclusion zones relative to “no fence” (p = 0.04). Further research should test different cattle groups in variable paddock settings and measure physiological welfare responses to the virtual fencing stimuli.},

  abstract = {Management prescriptions for contemporary ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) forests often incorporate the restoration to a structure that more closely resembles pre–European contact forests. Successful restoration programs should incorporate the herbaceous understory component; however, published research specifically addressing changes in understory species composition is minimal. Ponderosa pine influence on the undercanopy environment may be an important factor in understory vegetation distribution. In this study, we addressed the relationships among ponderosa pine abundance, undercanopy environment, and understory species composition and made inferences with respect to restoration potential. Data representing vegetation, soil, and environmental attributes were measured in 28 plots in an eastern Oregon ponderosa pine forest. Relationships among the parameters measured were evaluated using cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and ordination. Ponderosa pine occupancy was inversely related to understory perennial bunchgrass abundance and species diversity and appeared to regulate the undercanopy habitat through alterations in light intensity, nitrogen availability, and soil temperature. Light availability was the most important ponderosa pine–influenced undercanopy environmental parameter associated with understory vegetation distribution. These data suggested that degradation in the undercanopy environment associated with higher levels of ponderosa pine abundance may be temporary and that restoration practices that reduce pine occupancy should promote undercanopy conditions favorable to perennial bunchgrass growth. However, understory vegetation recovery in stands with excessive pine ingrowth may be constrained by desired understory species loss or invasion by more competitive understory vegetation. Resumen Las recomendaciones de manejo para los bosques contemporáneos de pino ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) incorporan a menudo la restauración de la estructura que se asemeje más a los bosques que había antes del contacto por los Europeos. Los programas exitosos de restauración deberían incorporar el componente herbáceo debajo de los árboles. Sin embargo, la investigación publicada que se enfoque específicamente en los cambios en la composición de las especies debajo de los arboles es mínima. La influencia del pino ponderosa en el ambiente debajo de la cubierta puede ser un factor importante en la distribución de la vegetación debajo de la cubierta de los arboles. En este estudio vimos las relaciones entre la abundancia del pino ponderosa, el medioambiente debajo de la cubierta de los arboles, y la composición de las especies debajo de la cubierta. Asimismo, se hicieron inferencias con respecto al potencial de restauración. Los datos representan vegetación, suelo, y los atributos del medio ambiente que se midieron en 28 parcelas en el bosque de pino ponderosa, en el oeste de Oregón. Las relaciones entre los parámetros medidos fueron evaluadas usando análisis cluster, análisis de las especies del indicador, así como la ordenación. La presencia del pino ponderosa fue inversamente relacionada con la abundancia de las gramíneas perenes amacolladas y con la diversidad de las especies y parece que regula el hábitat debajo de la cubierta de los arboles a través de la las alteraciones de la intensidad de la luz, disponibilidad de nitrógeno, y la temperatura del suelo. La disponibilidad de la luz fue el factor más importante en el pino ponderosa que influencia los parámetros del medio ambiente debajo de la cubierta asociados con la distribución de la vegetación debajo de la cubierta de los arboles. Estos datos sugieren que la degradación en el medio ambiente debajo de la cubierta de los arboles asociada con niveles más altos de la abundancia del pino ponderosa quizá sea temporal y que la práctica de restauración que reduce la presencia del pino debe promover las condiciones favorables debajo de la cubierta para el crecimiento de gramíneas perenes amacolladas. Sin embargo, la recuperación de la vegetación en grupos con un excesivo crecimiento del pino se puede forzar por la pérdida o la invasión de vegetación más competitiva.},

However, quantitative information on the capacity and mechanisms for wildlife to coexist with humans at fine spatial scales is scarce.

Here, we provide empirical information about the capacity and mechanisms for tigers (a globally endangered species) to coexist with humans at fine spatial scales inside and outside Nepal’s Chitwan National Park, a flagship protected area for imperiled wildlife. Information obtained from field cameras in 2010 and 2011 indicated that human presence (i.e., people on foot and vehicles) was ubiquitous and abundant throughout the study site; however, tiger density was also high. Surprisingly, even at a fine spatial scale (i.e., camera locations), tigers spatially overlapped with people on foot and vehicles in both years. However, in both years, tigers offset their temporal activity patterns to be much less active during the day when human activity peaked. In addition to temporal displacement, tiger–human coexistence was likely enhanced by abundant tiger prey and low levels of tiger poaching. Incorporating fine-scale spatial and temporal activity patterns into conservation plans can help address a major global challenge—meeting human needs while sustaining wildlife.},

Evaluation of resilience is hampered by the short history of logging, lack of long-term experiments and methodological limitations. To test the effect of clearcut logging, prescribed burning and reforestation on forest resilience, we recorded vascular plant cover repeatedly after treatment between 1981 and 2008 in 16 permanent research installations in three biogeoclimatic zones: Engelmann Spruce- Subalpine Fir, Interior Cedar-Hemlock and Sub-Boreal Spruce. We created a plant-trait dataset for the 181 recorded species to define plant functional types representing groups of plants that behave in similar ways and/or produce similar ecological outcomes. These plant functional types, along with taxonomic analysis of diagnostic and indicator species, were then used to evaluate plant community response to disturbance. Twenty years post-treatment, species diversity increased in all zones and plant abundance was greatest in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock. Cover of understory plant functional types associated with mature conifer forests increased in all zones, constituting a significant proportion ({$>$} 40\%) of the vegetation community by year 20. Response patterns varied by zone and with time. Understory species diagnostic of mature forests were present in all zones by year 20, but we identified indicator species sensitive to slashburning or requiring more time for recovery, including white-flowered rhododendron (Rhododendron albiflorum) and devil's club (Oplopanax horridus). Overall, loss of compositional or functional diversity following harvest and site remediation was not detected, suggesting that montane and subalpine forests in British Columbia are resilient to this treatment. However, because these forests can be slow to recover from disturbance, the post-disturbance assessment window of this study may not have been long enough to detect diminishment of ecosystem resilience.},

However, in the past these challenges were hardly considered, but in more recent times they have been increasingly considered by various faculties and graduate schools due to the expanding needs from growing enrolments. To further develop and strengthen the responses to these identified needs, this article reviews literature concerning challenges faced by beginning educational researchers in conducting literature review, aiming to help unpack this complicated phenomenon by constructing a coherent story. Based on our review, we propose a framework to conceptualize four types of challenges. We term them LMCO (linguistic, methodological, conceptual, and ontological) challenges. Discussions centers on the four identified challenges, recommendations for future studies and implications to graduate preparatory programs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little epidemiological information exists on overuse injuries in elite road cyclists. Anecdotal reports indicate anterior knee pain and lower back pain may be common problems. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to register overuse injuries among professional road cyclists with special focus on anterior knee and lower back pain. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: We attended training camps of 7 professional teams and interviewed 109 of 116 cyclists (94\%) on overuse injuries they had experienced in the previous 12 months. Injuries that required attention from medical personnel or involved time loss from cycling were registered. Additional information on anterior knee pain and lower back pain was collected using specific questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 94 injuries were registered; 45\% were in the lower back and 23\% in the knee. Twenty-three time-loss injuries were registered-57\% in the knee, 22\% in the lower back, and 13\% in the lower leg. Fifty-eight percent of all cyclists had experienced lower back pain in the previous 12 months, and 41\% of all cyclists had sought medical attention for it. Thirty-six percent had experienced anterior knee pain and 19\% had sought medical attention for it. Few cyclists had missed competitions because of pain in the lower back (6\%) or anterior knee (9\%). CONCLUSION: Lower back pain and anterior knee pain were the most prevalent overuse injuries, with knee injuries most likely to cause time loss and lower back pain causing the highest rates of functional impairment and medical attention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Future efforts to prevent overuse injuries in competitive cyclists should focus on lower back pain and anterior knee pain.},

  abstract = {Stubble height, a measure of the herbaceous vegetation remaining after grazing, has been widely used in recent years to gage the impacts of grazing use in riparian areas. Stubble height is a short-term management guide that should only be applied to help attain long-term ecological objectives; it should not be thought of as a long-term management objective. Maintaining a minimum stubble height helps preserve forage plant vigor, retain sufficient forage to reduce cattle browsing of willows (Salix spp.), stabilize sediments, indirectly limit stream-bank trampling, maintain cattle gains, and provide an easily communicated management criterion. Based on limited specific research of riparian system response and on knowledge of the characteristics of how cattle graze, a 10-cm residual stubble height is recommended by the authors as a starting point for improved riparian grazing management. Monitoring should then be conducted to determine if an adjustment is needed. In some situations, 7 cm or even less stubble height may provide for adequate riparian ecosystem function, particularly when stream-banks are dry and stable or possibly at high elevations where vegetation is naturally of low stature. In other situations, 15-20 cm of stubble height may be required to reduce browsing of willows or limit trampling impact to vulnerable streambanks. The recommended criterion would apply to streamside and nearby meadow sites with hydrophilic or potentially hydrophilic vegetation, but not directly to dry meadows or even to all wet meadows. Stubble height may have little application where the stream-banks are stabilized by coarse substrates, or the channels are deeply incised. The effects of residual stubble height in riparian functions have received limited direct experimental examination. Consequently, much of the information in this review was derived from studies indirectly related to the questions raised and, to some extent, from observations of experienced professionals. The authors have identified areas of scientific investigation needed to improve our understanding of the effects of stubble height on riparian function and grazing management. /// La altura del rastrojo, una medida de la vegetación herb-cea remanente después de que ha sido sujeta apacentamiento, ha sido ampliamente utilizada en años recientes para medir el impacto del apacentamiento en las áeas ribereñas. La altura del rastrojo es una guáa de manejo a corto plazo que debe ser aplicada solo para ayudar a lograr los objetivos ecológicos de largo plazo y no debe ser tomada como un objetivo de manejo a largo plazo. El mantener una altura mánima del rastrojo ayuda a preservar el vigor de las plantas forrajeras, retener suficiente forraje para reducir el ramoneo de "Willows" (Salix spp.) por el ganado, estabilizar los sedimientos e indirectamente limitar el pisoteo del banco de la corriente, mantener las ganancias del ganado y proveer un criterio de manejo f-cilmente comunicable. Basado en la escaza investigación especifica sobre la respuesta de los sistemas ribereños y en el conocimiento de como el ganado apacienta, se recomienda una altura del rastrojo de 10 cm como el punto inicial para el manejo del apacentamiento que mejore las áeas ribereña. El monitoreo debe entonces ser conducido para determinar si es necesario un ajuste. En algunas situaciones 7 o menos centámetros de altura del rastrojo pueden ser suficientes para el buen funcionamiento del sistema ribereño, particularmente cuando el banco de la corriente est·n secos y estables o posiblemente en elevaciones altas donde la vegetación por naturaleza es de porte bajo.

  abstract = {Cattle graze seasonally on national forests in the Western United States, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and/or elk (Cervus elaphus) are sympatric with cattle in most of these areas. But the effects of interspecific interactions in terms of both the resources selected and animal distributions across landscapes are poorly understood. At the USDA Forest Service Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey), located in northeast Oregon, USA, elk and mule deer were free ranging within a 78 km2 study area enclosed by a 2.4 m high fence while cattle were moved among pastures in summer on a deferred-rotation schedule. Elk, mule deer, and cattle were located with an automated telemetry system from 1993-1996 and locations linked to a geographic information system (GIS) of Starkey. Our objective was to examine responses of elk and mule deer to cattle at multiple spatial and temporal levels. We compared elk and mule deer distributions, use of plant communities, and resource selection functions in one cattle pasture (24 km2) during early summer (cattle present in odd-numbered years) and late summer (cattle present in even-numbered years). Elk and deer differed in their spatial and temporal responses to presence of cattle. When cattle were present, the proportion of elk locations within the pasture decreased and use of the ponderosa pine/Douglas fir (Pinus ponderosa/Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant community within the pasture decreased in early summer and increased in late summer. The cattle resource selection function variable for early summer was not a predictor of elk distributions when cattle were present, but it was a predictor on years when cattle were absent. In late summer, the cattle resource selection function variable was a predictor of elk distributions regardless of presence of cattle. For mule deer distributions the cattle resource selection function variable was not a significant predictor in early summer (cattle present or absent). or in late summer when cattle were present, but it was a negative predictor of mule deer distributions when cattle were absent in late summer. Mule deer use increased or decreased in opposite direction from elk use in 3 of 4 season/year combinations for both pasture and ponderosa pine/Douglas fir. Our results suggest that competition for forage could occur between elk and cattle in late summer and that species interactions may be stronger between elk and cattle than mule deer and cattle. We recommend that managers look closely at stocking levels in late summer because cattle and elk use some of the same resources during that period, and to pay particular attention to the ponderosa pine/Douglas fir plant community where we found significant interactions between cattle and elk.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread and diversification of outdoor recreation can impact on wildlife in various ways, often leading to the avoidance of disturbed habitats. To mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, spatial zonation schemes can be implemented to separate human activities from key wildlife habitats, e.g., by designating undisturbed wildlife refuges or areas with some level of restriction to human recreation and land use. However, mitigation practice rarely considers temporal differences in human-wildlife interactions. We used GPS telemetry data from 15 red deer to study the seasonal (winter vs. summer) and diurnal (day vs. night) variation in recreation effects on habitat use in a study region in south-western Germany where a spatial zonation scheme has been established. Our study aimed to determine if recreation infrastructure and spatial zonation affected red deer habitat use and whether these effects varied daily or seasonally. Recreation infrastructure did not affect home range selection in the study area, but strongly determined habitat use within the home range. The spatial zonation scheme was reflected in both of these two levels of habitat selection, with refuges and core areas being more frequently used than the border zones. Habitat use differed significantly between day and night in both seasons. Both summer and winter recreation trails, and nearby foraging habitats, were avoided during day, whereas a positive association was found during night. We conclude that human recreation has an effect on red deer habitat use, and when designing mitigation measures daily and seasonal variation in human-wildlife interactions should be taken into account. We advocate using spatial zonation in conjunction with temporal restrictions (i.e., banning nocturnal recreation activities) and the creation of suitable foraging habitats away from recreation trails.},

Whilst some benefits have proved elusive, others contribute positively to today's agriculture. Research continues to be necessary and needs to be reported and disseminated to a wide audience. These proceedings contain the reviewed papers from the 4th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming. The papers reflect the wide range of disciplines that impinge upon precision livestock farming including feeding dairy, data quality, poultry and pig applications, livestock environment, wireless sensing, dairy fertility and calving management, animal identification, mastitis detection and locomotion. The broad range of research topics reported are a valuable resource for researchers, advisors, teachers and professionals in agriculture. Also note that the reviewed papers from the 7th European Conference on Precision Agriculture are presented in a companion publication.},

  abstract = {In the 1880's, intensive accelerated erosion began producing large gullies throughout the Southwestern United States. This modern arroyo cutting was originally attributed to deterioration of the protective vegetation cover because of below normal rainfall and overgrazing by excessive numbers of livestock (4,000,000 sheep in New Mexico in 1880). However, recent studies have stressed the greater importance of increased high intensity rainfall. Additional perspective is provided by an examination of livestock numbers in the upper Rio Grande region of New Mexico during the 19th century, particularly during the Mexican period when the ranges were heavily stocked with sheep (possibly 3,000,000 head in the 1820's), but with little or no gullying. The incomplete record of livestock numbers in relation to climate and gullying backs up the climatic argument but also gives some new support to the older view that overgrazing was a major contributive factor causing severe modern gullying.},

  abstract = {1 Range management is based on the response of plant species and communities to grazing intensity. The identification of easily measured plant functional traits that consistently predict grazing response in a wide spectrum of rangelands would be a major advance. 2 Sets of species from temperate subhumid upland grasslands of Argentina and Israel, grazed by cattle, were analysed to find out whether: (i) plants with contrasting grazing responses differed in terms of easily measured vegetative and life-history traits; (ii) their grazing response could be predicted from those traits; (iii) these patterns differed between the two countries. Leaf mass, area, specific area (SLA) and toughness were measured on 83 Argentine and 19 Israeli species. Species were classified by grazing response (grazing-susceptible or grazing-resistant) and plant height ({$<$} or {$>$} 40 cm) as well as by life history (annual or perennial) and taxonomy (monocotyledon or dicotyledon). 3 Similar plant traits were associated with a specific response to grazing in both Argentina and Israel. Grazing-resistant species were shorter in height, and had smaller, more tender, leaves, with higher SLA than grazing-susceptible species. Grazing resistance was associated with both avoidance traits (small height and leaf size) and tolerance traits (high SLA). Leaf toughness did not contribute to grazing resistance and may be related to selection for canopy dominance. 4 Plant height was the best single predictor of grazing response, followed by leaf mass. The best prediction of species grazing response was achieved by combining plant height, life history and leaf mass. SLA was a comparatively poor predictor of grazing response. 5 The ranges of plant traits, and some correlation patterns between them, differed markedly between species sets from Argentina and Israel. However, the significant relationships between plant traits and grazing response were maintained. 6 The results of this exploratory study suggest that prediction of grazing responses on the basis of easily measured plant traits is feasible and consistent between similar grazing systems in different regions. The results challenge the precept that intense cattle grazing necessarily favours species with tough, unpalatable, leaves.},

  abstract = {Large carnivores are persecuted globally because they threaten human industries and livelihoods. How this conflict is managed has consequences for the conservation of large carnivores and biodiversity more broadly. Mitigating human–predator conflict should be evidence-based and accommodate people's values while protecting carnivores. Despite much research into human and large-carnivore coexistence strategies, there have been few attempts to document the success of conflict-mitigation strategies on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of global research on conflict mitigation related to large carnivores and humans. We focused on conflicts that arise from the threat large carnivores pose to livestock. We first used structured and unstructured searching to identify replicated studies that used before–after or control–impact design to measure change in livestock loss as a result of implementing a management intervention. We then extracted relevant data from these studies to calculate an overall effect size for each intervention type. Research effort and focus varied among continents and aligned with the histories and cultures that shaped livestock production and attitudes toward carnivores. Livestock guardian animals most effectively reduced livestock losses. Lethal control was the second most effective control, although its success varied the most, and guardian animals and lethal control did not differ significantly. Financial incentives have promoted tolerance of large carnivores in some settings and reduced retaliatory killings. We suggest coexistence strategies be location-specific, incorporate cultural values and environmental conditions, and be designed such that return on financial investment can be evaluated. Improved monitoring of mitigation measures is urgently required to promote effective evidence-based policy.},

  abstract = {Large carnivores are persecuted globally because they threaten human industries and livelihoods. How this conflict is managed has consequences for the conservation of large carnivores and biodiversity more broadly. Mitigating human–predator conflict should be evidence-based and accommodate people's values while protecting carnivores. Despite much research into human and large-carnivore coexistence strategies, there have been few attempts to document the success of conflict-mitigation strategies on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of global research on conflict mitigation related to large carnivores and humans. We focused on conflicts that arise from the threat large carnivores pose to livestock. We first used structured and unstructured searching to identify replicated studies that used before–after or control–impact design to measure change in livestock loss as a result of implementing a management intervention. We then extracted relevant data from these studies to calculate an overall effect size for each intervention type. Research effort and focus varied among continents and aligned with the histories and cultures that shaped livestock production and attitudes toward carnivores. Livestock guardian animals most effectively reduced livestock losses. Lethal control was the second most effective control, although its success varied the most, and guardian animals and lethal control did not differ significantly. Financial incentives have promoted tolerance of large carnivores in some settings and reduced retaliatory killings. We suggest coexistence strategies be location-specific, incorporate cultural values and environmental conditions, and be designed such that return on financial investment can be evaluated. Improved monitoring of mitigation measures is urgently required to promote effective evidence-based policy.},

Modifications to Roosevelt Dam, completed in 1996, raised the height of the dam and resulted in a high probability of willow flycatcher habitat inundation within the reservoir's conservation pool. We collected habitat measurements and monitored 922 willow flycatcher nests from 1996 to 2006 to investigate effects of inundation on willow flycatcher habitat and subsequent changes in nest success, productivity, and distribution. Inundation of willow flycatcher habitat at Roosevelt Lake occurred in 2005, changing the location and amount of suitable breeding habitat and significantly altering habitat structure (e.g., thinner vegetation, more canopy gaps) of formally occupied nest sites. The willow flycatcher population at Roosevelt Lake decreased 47\% from 209 territories in 2004 to 111 territories in 2006 in response to habitat changes. Willow flycatchers made fewer nesting attempts and nest success rates were significantly lower during inundation (2005 and 2006: 45\%) than preinundation (1996-2004: 57\%). Combined, these factors negatively affected the population's productivity during inundation. Although inundation caused extensive vegetation die-off, we did observe regeneration of vegetation in some areas at Roosevelt Lake in 2006. The Roosevelt Lake population remains one of the largest willow flycatcher populations in the state and territory numbers remain high enough that the population may not suffer long-term effects if sufficient suitable habitat continues to exist during the cycle of inundation and regeneration. Reservoir managers may be able to develop dam management guidelines that reduce damage to habitat, encourage habitat growth, and mimic the dynamic nature of unaltered riparian habitat. These guidelines can be implemented, as appropriate, at reservoirs throughout the willow flycatcher's range.]},

Available evidence suggests a threshold amount of habitat loss at which the probability of population extinction increases from near-zero to near-one following a small additional loss of habitat. The main factors thought to determine this extinction threshold are reproductive rate of the organism, rate of emigration of the organism from habitat, habitat pattern in the landscape (fragmentation), and matrix quality (survival rate of the organism in non-habitat areas). Effective conservation measures require knowledge not only of what factors determine the threshold, but also the relative magnitudes of their effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relative effects of these four factors on the extinction threshold, using a spatially-explicit simulation model. Reproductive rate had the largest potential effect on the extinction threshold. The rate of emigration from habitat also had a very strong predicted effect on the extinction threshold; the higher the rate of emigration, the more habitat was needed for persistence. Matrix quality had a moderate effect, and habitat pattern had a very small predicted effect. The simulations predicted that under certain circumstances up to 58\% less habitat is required for population persistence, if a matrix of very low quality is converted to a matrix of very high quality. Matrix quality can be improved by maintaining heterogeneous landscapes with a diversity of vegetated features, and by reducing factors causing direct mortality of dispersers such as road traffic and pesticides. In summary, the simulations suggest that (i) the first priority for conservation should be habitat preservation and restoration, (ii) information on movement rates of organisms is critical for predicting extinction thresholds and (iii) conservation strategies should consider the quality of the whole landscape, including the matrix.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Security infrastructure along international boundaries threatens to degrade connectivity for wildlife. To explore potential effects of a fence under construction along the U.S.–Mexico border on wildlife, we assessed movement behavior of two species with different life histories whose regional persistence may depend on transboundary movements. We used radiotelemetry to assess how vegetation and landscape structure affect flight and natal dispersal behaviors of Ferruginous Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium brasilianum), and satellite telemetry, gene-flow estimates, and least-cost path models to assess movement behavior and interpopulation connectivity of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Flight height of Pygmy-Owls averaged only 1.4 m (SE 0.1) above ground, and only 23\% of flights exceeded 4 m. Juvenile Pygmy-Owls dispersed at slower speeds, changed direction more, and had lower colonization success in landscapes with larger vegetation openings or higher levels of disturbance (p ≤ 0.047), which suggests large vegetation gaps coupled with tall fences may limit transboundary movements. Female bighorn sheep crossed valleys up to 4.9 km wide, and microsatellite analyses indicated relatively high levels of gene flow and migration (95\% CI for FST=0.010–0.115, Nm = 1.9–24.8, M =10.4–15.4) between populations divided by an 11-km valley. Models of gene flow based on regional topography and movement barriers suggested that nine populations of bighorn sheep in northwestern Sonora are linked by dispersal with those in neighboring Arizona. Disruption of transboundary movement corridors by impermeable fencing would isolate some populations on the Arizona side. Connectivity for other species with similar movement abilities and spatial distributions may be affected by border development, yet mitigation strategies could address needs of wildlife and humans.},

  abstract = {(1) Cover is among the most widely used measures of abundance of plant species because it is not biased by the size or distribution of individuals. This study compared cover estimates obtained by line interception, point interception, and cover-class estimation from 136 sample lines located systematically in sagebrush steppe in western U.S.A. (2) Line interception estimates of shrub cover were significantly higher than those obtained by point interception; estimates of `bare ground and litter' by point interception were higher than those of line interception by the same amount. These offsetting differences resulted from the assumption, used in line interception sampling, that shrubs completely cover the areas within the outlines of their canopies. Otherwise, point interception and line interception estimates were very similar. (3) Cover-class estimation provided reliable estimates only for the dominant shrub species. Typically, estimates for grasses and other species with small or rare individuals were high in comparison with the other techniques. This is a consequence of the assumption that cover values are uniformly distributed about the mid-points of the cover classes. (4) Point interception achieved about the same degree of precision as line interception in one-third less sampling time. Point interception is the most efficient of the three methods where estimates for most of the species in a community are needed. (5) Optimal combinations of numbers of lines and numbers of sample units per line in relation to the time involved for a particular level of precision were investigated. In general, increased precision was achieved by sampling more lines rather than more sample units per line.},

  abstract = {This article examines the question of how well the rangeland management profession has served conservation of patterns and processes that support multiple ecosystem services. We examine the paradigms under which rangeland management operates and argue that our profession developed under the utilitarian paradigm with the primary goals of sustainable forage for livestock production. While optimization of multiple rangeland products and services has always been a consideration, a comprehensive set of principles have not be been developed to advance this concept. We argue that fire and grazing, often viewed as mere tools used for production goals, should rather be viewed as essential ecosystem processes. Rangeland management continues to operate under the utilitarian paradigm appropriate to societal values of the 20th century and by and large has failed to provide management guidance to reverse degradation of several highly valued ecosystem services. We support this argument with evidence that biodiversity has declined on rangelands in the past half century and that much of this decline is due to management goals that favor a narrow suite of species. The full suite of ecosystem services valued by society will only benefit by management for heterogeneity, which implies that there is no one goal for management and that landscape-level planning is crucial. Explicitly incorporating heterogeneity into state-and-transition models is an important advancement not yet achieved by our profession. We present new principles for rangeland management formed on the basis of conservation of pattern and process. While recognizing that many rangelands have significant deviations from historic plant communities and disturbance regimes, we suggest that management for conservation of pattern and process should focus on fire and grazing to the extent possible to promote a shifting mosaic across large landscapes that include patches that are highly variable in the amount of disturbance rather than the current goal of uniform moderate disturbance. Resumen Este artículo examina la pregunta de que tan bien los profesionales en manejo de pastizales han aplicado los patrones y procesos en la conservación de los servicios multiples que proveen los ecosistemas. Examinamos los paradigmas bajo los cuales opera el manejo de pastizales y discutimos el desarrollo de nuestra profesión bajo el paradigma utilitario con el principal objetivo de sustentabilidad forrajera para la producción de ganado. Mientras que la optimización de los múltiples productos y servicios de los pastizales han sido consideradas un paquete completo de principios no ha sido desarrollado para avanzar en este concepto. Discutimos que el fuego y el pastoreo a veces son vistos como simples herramientas usadas para objetivos de producción cuando deberían ser vistas como partes esenciales de los procesos del ecosistema. El manejo de pastizales continúa operando bajo el paradigma utilitario típico de los valores sociales del siglo XX y por mucho ha fallado en proveer directrices de manejo para revertir la degradación de varios servicios valiosos de los ecosistemas. Apoyamos este argumento con evidencia de que la biodiversidad ha decaído en los pastizales en la mitad del siglo pasado y mucho de esta disminución se debe a los objetivos de manejo que favorecen a un reducido número de especies. El juego completo de servicios valuados por la sociedad solo beneficiara con el manejo por heterogeneidad el cual implica que no hay un objetivo para el manejo y que la planeación a nivel paisaje es crucial. Incorporando de manera explícita modelos de estado y transición es un avance importante que no ha sido logrado por nuestra profesión. Presentamos nuevos principios para el manejo de pastizales desarrollados en base a procesos y patrones de conservación. Mientras reconozcamos que muchos pastizales tienen desviaciones significativas de históricas comunidades de plantas y regímenes de disturbio, sugerimos que el manejo por conservación de patrones y procesos deberá enfocarse en fuego y pastoreo en medida de lo posible para promover el cambio en un mosaico a través de grandes paisajes que incluyen parches que son altamente variables en la magnitud de disturbio en lugar de objetivos actuales de disturbio uniforme y moderado.},

  abstract = {Public lands occupied by feral horses in North America are frequently managed for multiple uses with land use conflict occurring among feral horses, livestock, wildlife, and native grassland conservation. The factors affecting habitat use by horses is critical to understand where conflict may be greatest. We related horse presence and abundance to landscape attributes in a GIS to examine habitat preferences using 98 field plots sampled within a portion of the Rocky Mountain Forest Reserve of SW Alberta, Canada. Horse abundance was greatest in grassland and cut block habitats, and lowest in conifer and mixedwood forest. Resource selection probability functions and count models of faecal abundance indicated that horses preferred areas closer to water, with reduced topographic ruggedness, situated farther from forests, and located farther away from primary roads and trails frequented by recreationalists, but closer to small linear features (i.e. cut lines) that may be used as beneficial travel corridors. Horse presence and abundance were closely related to cattle presence during summer, suggesting that both herbivores utilise the same habitats. Estimates of forage biomass removal (44~\%) by mid-July were near maximum acceptable levels. In contrast to horse-cattle associations, horses were negatively associated with wild ungulate abundance, although the mechanism behind this remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Our results indicate that feral horses in SW Alberta exhibit complex habitat selection patterns during spring and summer, including overlap in use with livestock. This finding highlights the need to assess and manage herbivore populations consistent with rangeland carrying capacity and the maintenance of range health.},

  abstract = {Previous work on the US Atlantic coast has generally shown that coastal foredunes are dominated by two dune grass species, Ammophila breviligulata (American beachgrass) and Uniola paniculata (sea oats). From Virginia northward, A. breviligulata dominates, while U. paniculata is the dominant grass south of Virginia. Previous work suggests that these grasses influence the shape of coastal foredunes in species-specific ways, and that they respond differently to environmental stressors; thus, it is important to know which species dominates a given dune system. The range boundaries of these two species remains unclear given the lack of comprehensive surveys. In an attempt to determine these boundaries, we conducted a literature survey of 98 studies that either stated the range limits and/or included field-based studies/observations of the two grass species. We then produced an interactive map that summarizes the locations of the surveyed papers and books. The literature review suggests that the current southern range limit for A. breviligulata is Cape Fear, NC, and the northern range limit for U. paniculata is Assateague Island, on the Maryland and Virginia border. Our data suggest a northward expansion of U. paniculata, possibly associated with warming trends observed near the northern range limit in Painter, VA. In contrast, the data regarding a range shift for A. breviligulata remain inconclusive. We also compare our literature-based map with geolocated records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and iNaturalist research grade crowd-sourced observations. We intend for our literature-based map to aid coastal researchers who are interested in the dynamics of these two species and the potential for their ranges to shift as a result of climate change.},

  abstract = {Studying large mammal species in tropical forests is a conservation challenge with species’ behavior and ecology often increasing the probability of non-detection during surveys. Consequently, knowledge of the distribution, status, and natural history of many large mammal species in Southeast Asia is limited. I developed occupancy models from camera-trapping data, thereby accounting for imperfect detection at sampling sites, to clarify the status and habitat requirements of four globally threatened or near threatened large mammals (banteng Bos javanicus, gaur Bos gaurus, dhole Cuon alpinus, and leopard Panthera pardus) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, eastern Cambodia. Camera traps were operational for {$>$}3500 trap nights with 202 photographic encounters of the four study species. Model averaged occupancy estimates were between 5 percent (leopard) and 140 percent (gaur) higher than naive estimates (i.e., proportion of camera-trap sites species recorded from) thus highlighting the importance of accounting for detectability during conservation surveys. I recommend the use of an occupancy framework when using camera-trap data to study the status, ecology, and habitat preferences of poorly known and elusive species. The results highlight the importance of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest for wild cattle in eastern Cambodia and I emphasize that these habitats must be considered in conservation planning across the Lower Mekong Dry Forest Ecoregion.},

  abstract = {Studying large mammal species in tropical forests is a conservation challenge with species’ behavior and ecology often increasing the probability of non-detection during surveys. Consequently, knowledge of the distribution, status, and natural history of many large mammal species in Southeast Asia is limited. I developed occupancy models from camera-trapping data, thereby accounting for imperfect detection at sampling sites, to clarify the status and habitat requirements of four globally threatened or near threatened large mammals (banteng Bos javanicus, gaur Bos gaurus, dhole Cuon alpinus, and leopard Panthera pardus) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, eastern Cambodia. Camera traps were operational for {$>$}3500 trap nights with 202 photographic encounters of the four study species. Model averaged occupancy estimates were between 5 percent (leopard) and 140 percent (gaur) higher than naive estimates (i.e., proportion of camera-trap sites species recorded from) thus highlighting the importance of accounting for detectability during conservation surveys. I recommend the use of an occupancy framework when using camera-trap data to study the status, ecology, and habitat preferences of poorly known and elusive species. The results highlight the importance of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest for wild cattle in eastern Cambodia and I emphasize that these habitats must be considered in conservation planning across the Lower Mekong Dry Forest Ecoregion.},

Feeding dominated elk activity (51 ± 4 [SE]\%) followed by resting (36 ± 3\%), and moving (11 ± 3\%). Significant seasonal cycles in elk feeding and resting behavior were documented and described by sine functions. Feeding declined by 10\% from summer to winter while resting increased by 10\%. Diurnal feeding decreased 70\% when elk migrated from summer to winter ranges. Nocturnal feeding changed in proportion to the relative length of night. Major daily feeding periods coincided with sunrise and sunset. Elk alternately fed and rested throughout the day on summer range. On winter range, elk rested for extended periods during daylight, but fed and rested during the night.},

  abstract = {The area dominated by the shrubs creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) in the American southwest has increased several-fold over the last century, with a corresponding decrease in areal coverage of productive grasslands and increased surface soil erosion throughout the region. The factors thought to be responsible for this regional shift in vegetation are: (1) overgrazing by domestic livestock; (2) fire suppression; and (3) historical changes in climate. We examine the evidence concerning each of these factors and develop a synthetic model outlining the principles affecting shrubland encroachment, which focuses on life history characteristics of the dominant shrubs and a number of positive biotic and edaphic feedback mechanisms contributing to their establishment and persistence. We conclude that the expansion of shrub dominance that has occurred over the last century may have been triggered by extreme live-stock overgrazing at the end of the nineteenth century, which coincided with rainfall regimes that were unfavorable for perennial grass growth. Hence, the landscape we observe today may be a product of positive feedback mechanisms triggered over a century ago by management practices that were uninformed with regard to the importance of historical climate patterns and the life history characteristics of important rangeland species. Our consideration of these issues also addresses potential land surface - climate interactions that could occur as a result of regional alterations in vegetation dominance and physiognomy.},

  abstract = {The Walker Basin Allotment grazing system in central Arizona is designed to allocate resource use under elk (Cervus elaphus L.) and cattle (Bos taurus L.) grazing. The grazing system was designed to promote biologically acceptable levels of forage use on the half of the allotment scheduled for cattle grazing and to rest the other half by attracting elk to pastures recently grazed by cattle. The objectives of our 2-year study were to determine whether the grazing system facilitated proper forage use as defined by recent forage use and residual stubble height guidelines (i.e., 30 to 40\% use and an 8- to 10-cm stubble height) and whether the system rested one half of the allotment from elk and cattle grazing. Mean (+/- SEM) total elk and cattle forage use for western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii Rydb.), the key forage species, was 32 and 61\% +/- 7 in 1997 and 1998, respectively; corresponding mean (+/- SEM) stubble heights were 11 and 10 cm +/- 0.6. Mean total cattle and elk forage use in 1998 (61\%) exceeded the 30 to 40\% use guidelines. However, mean end-of-year stubble height was never below 10 cm. The grazing system did not provide half the allotment with complete rest; elk used all study pastures. Elk use was higher in pastures with heavier tree cover and steeper terrain in both years, regardless of where cattle grazing occurred. Elk grazing patterns were apparently more dependent on tree cover and topography than any changes in forage caused by the grazing system.},

  abstract = {Reasons for performing study: The distance travelled by Australian feral horses in an unrestricted environment has not previously been determined. It is important to investigate horse movement in wilderness environments to establish baseline data against which the movement of domestically managed horses and wild equids can be compared. Objectives: To determine the travel dynamics of 2 groups of feral horses in unrestricted but different wilderness environments. Methods: Twelve feral horses living in 2 wilderness environments (2000 vs. 20,000 km2) in outback Australia were tracked for 6.5 consecutive days using custom designed, collar mounted global positioning systems (GPS). Collars were attached after darting and immobilising the horses. The collars were recovered after a minimum of 6.5 days by re-darting the horses. Average daily distance travelled was calculated. Range use and watering patterns of horses were analysed by viewing GPS tracks overlaid on satellite photographs of the study area. Results: Average distance travelled was 15.9 ± 1.9 km/day (range 8.1–28.3 km/day). Horses were recorded up to 55 km from their watering points and some horses walked for 12 h to water from feeding grounds. Mean watering frequency was 2.67 days (range 1–4 days). Central Australian horses watered less frequently and showed a different range use compared to horses from central Queensland. Central Australian horses walked for long distances in direct lines to patchy food sources whereas central Queensland horses were able to graze close to water sources and moved in a more or less circular pattern around the central water source. Conclusions: The distances travelled by feral horses were far greater than those previously observed for managed domestic horses and other species of equid. Feral horses are able to travel long distances and withstand long periods without water, allowing them to survive in semi-arid conditions.},

Understanding habitat selection patterns and the ability to identify potential breeding areas for the SWFL is crucial to the management and conservation of this species. We developed a multiscaled model of SWFL breeding habitat with a Geographic Information System (GIS), survey data, GIS variables, and multiple logistic regressions. We obtained presence and absence survey data from a riverine ecosystem and a reservoir delta in south-central Arizona, USA, in 1999. We extracted the GIS variables from satellite imagery and digital elevation models to characterize vegetation and floodplain within the project area. We used multiple logistic regressions within a cell-based (30 × 30 m) modeling environment to (1) determine associations between GIS variables and breeding-site occurrence at different spatial scales (0.09-72 ha), and (2) construct a predictive model. Our best model explained 54\% of the variability in breeding-site occurrence with the following variables: vegetation density at the site (0.09 ha), proportion of dense vegetation and variability in vegetation density within a 4.5-ha neighborhood, and amount of floodplain or flat terrain within a 41-ha neighborhood. The density of breeding sites was highest in areas that the model predicted to be most suitable within the project area and at an external test site 200 km away. Conservation efforts must focus on protecting not only occupied patches, but also surrounding riparian forests and floodplain to ensure long-term viability of SWFL. We will use the multiscaled model to map SWFL breeding habitat in Arizona, prioritize future survey effort, and examine changes in habitat abundance and quality over time.},

  abstract = {Feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) populations on public rangelands in the western United States threaten forage production for livestock and wildlife habitat. Interference competition between feral horses and heterospecifics at watering sources can have negative effects on livestock and wildlife. Researchers have documented altered timing and behavior of wild ungulates at water sources when horses were present. The few studies examining these interactions have infrequently occurred within areas specifically managed for feral equids and have not occurred in sites with cattle. We used motion-sensitive cameras at 8 watering sources to document watering activity patterns and construct indices of temporal overlap among feral horses, cattle, elk (Cervus canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) within the Adobe Town Herd Management Area in southern Wyoming, USA, between June and September 2018 and 2019. Feral horses, cattle, and pronghorn exhibited a high degree of temporal overlap ({$>$}79\%) in water use, with feral horses and pronghorn exhibiting the highest estimated percent overlap (88.1\%, 95\% CI = 86.5–89.6\%). Mule deer and elk watering activity also overlapped with horses and cattle but to a lesser degree ({$<$}55\%). Feral horses spent a mean of 16.7 ± 30.5 (SD) minutes during a watering event and were present at a given water source on average 4.5 ± 6.3\% and up to 34.9\% of the day, which is less than reported in previous studies. Cattle spent on average 23.5 ± 44.9 minutes during a watering event, and were present on average 4.2 ± 7.7\% and up to 42.4\% of the day at a single water source. Results of generalized linear mixed-effects models indicated that number of conspecifics was the strongest predictor of visit duration for pronghorn and horses; hour of the day and group size of heterospecifics were informative, but less important, variables. There was no difference in peak visitation time for any species between sites of high versus low horse or cattle use. Despite temporal overlap, we did not find evidence of interference competition between feral horses, cattle, and pronghorn. We recommend future examination of interference competition and its biological consequences between introduced and native ungulates at water sources of varying size across sites, equid population levels, and livestock stocking rates. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Most of our knowledge of the effect of grazing on grassland structure is based on grazed–ungrazed contrasts. The effects of grazing in the most common scenario, where grazing intensity varies from low to high grazing intensity, are less known. The objectives of this paper were to 1) quantify the effect of stocking rates on species richness and diversity of grasslands world-wide, and 2) evaluate the response under different environmental and experimental conditions. We conducted a meta-analysis of experiments with at least two levels of controlled stocking rates and evaluated their effect on species richness and diversity. The results showed that the response of richness and diversity to either reducing or increasing stocking rate from a moderate level mostly fell within the range  25\% or  5 species. Mean response of species richness and diversity to increasing stocking rate from moderate to high levels was negative. Mean response to lowering stocking rate from moderate levels was not different from zero. However, overall, species richness significantly decreased as stocking rate increased. The response of richness and diversity to stocking rate was not related to mean precipitation, productivity or aridity. However, the most negative responses of richness to stocking rate were larger in arid, low productivity systems than in subhumid and humid systems. The effects of grazing on richness and diversity found in this review were smaller than the effects on species composition shown by the literature. Thus, grazing drastically changes species composition, but the net change of species and diversity is much smaller.},

  abstract = {Geomorphic reclamation creates variable topography and surface architecture, including rolling hillslopes and drainages. In contrast, traditional methods of reclamation result in landscapes susceptible to erosion due to steep, linear gradients. Geomorphic approaches to surface mine reclamation are relatively new, and hypotheses suggest the use of geomorphic principles in reclamation will improve vegetation outcomes relative to traditional methods. Topographic variability created by geomorphic reclamation likely results in more environmental heterogeneity, which should correlate with greater plant diversity. We examined revegetation outcomes of traditional and geomorphic reclamation on two reclaimed surface mines in Wyoming using nadir image sampling. Functional group diversity and measures of cover were compared between reclamation methods and undisturbed rangeland. Geomorphic reclamation supported greater total richness and greater native functional group richness relative to traditional reclamation. Native species cover on geomorphic reclamation, particularly for native perennial grasses, was either similar to undisturbed rangeland or greater than undisturbed rangeland and traditional reclamation. Reclamation shrub cover differed significantly from undisturbed sites, but was greater in geomorphic treatments. Results of nadir image analysis are compared to line-point intercept data from the same locations and outcomes are discussed in light of different reclamation techniques and sampling methods. Significant differences in cover categories were observed between nadir image and line-point intercept methods, however both methods revealed similar patterns between study sites.},

  abstract = {Methods: We simulated cover class data by ‘‘cuttingup’’ a continuous logit-beta distributed variable using 7-point and 15-point cover classification schemes. We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate power for detecting trends with two ordinal models, proportional odds logistic regression (POM) and logistic regression with cover classes rebinned into two categories, a model we term an assessment point model (APM). We include a model fit to the logit-transformed percentage cover data for comparison, which is a latent model. Results: The POM had equal or higher power compared to the APM and latent model, but power varied in complex ways as a function of the assumed latent beta distribution. We discovered that if the latent distribution is skewed, a cover class scheme with more categories might yield higher power to detect trend. Conclusions: Our power analysis method maintains the connection between the observed ordinal cover classes and the unmeasured (latent) percentage cover variable, allowing for a biologically meaningful trend to be defined on the percentage cover scale. Both the shape of the latent beta distribution and the alternative hypothesis should be considered carefully when determining sample size requirements for long-term vegetation monitoring using cover class measurements.},

  abstract = {The potential for interspecific competition for food resources is a key consideration when newly introduced ungulates occupy a shared range with resident native species. Management plans in Yukon, Canada, for reintroduced bison (Bison bison) and introduced elk (Cervus canadensis) called for an assessment of competition for food resources between these species and resident populations of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli), and moose (Alces americanus). To assess potential competition among ungulates, we examined dietary overlap of 7 ungulate species in southwestern Yukon, Canada. We compared diet composition at the forage class level and composite diet indices (diversity, evenness, and niche breadth) among species found at 2 elevation classes (high [!1,200 m ASL] and low [{$<$}1,200 m ASL]) during summer and winter, using data derived from microhistological analyses of feces. Composite indices and percent of key forage classes in diets differed among ungulates during summer and winter and at both high and low elevations. Potential dietary overlap for most species pairs was low to moderate (0.07–0.60). However, for bison and thinhorn sheep at high elevations, and bison and semi-feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) at low elevations, it was high (0.82–0.97) during both summer and winter, indicating potential for food competition. Dietary overlap between species appeared to be based primarily on morphophysiological classification (i.e., browser-intermediate-grazer), rather than body size. Bison, horses, and sheep were all grazers. Intermediate species, such as introduced elk, had only moderate dietary overlap with several species. We concluded that the potential for competition for food resources based on dietary overlap between bison and sheep and bison and horses may be high in our study area, depending on forage availability, but for all other species pairs in our study area the potential for forage competition is low to moderate.

  abstract = {Fitness of female ungulates is determined by neonate survival and lifetime reproductive success. Therefore, adult female ungulates should adopt behaviors and habitat selection patterns that enhance survival of neonates during parturition and lactation. Parturition site location may play an important role in neonatal mortality of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) when lambs are especially vulnerable to predation, but parturition sites are rarely documented for this species. Our objectives were to assess environmental characteristics at desert bighorn parturition, lamb nursery, and predation sites and to assess differences in habitat characteristics between parturition sites and nursery group sites, and predation sites and nursery group sites. We used vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) to identify parturition sites and capture neonates. We then compared elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness, and visibility at parturition, nursery, and lamb predation sites with paired random sites and compared characteristics of parturition sites and lamb predation sites to those of nursery sites. When compared to random sites, odds of a site being a parturition site were highest at intermediate slopes and decreased with increasing female visibility. Odds of a site being a predation site increased with decreasing visibility. When compared to nursery group sites, odds of a site being a parturition site had a quadratic relationship with elevation and slope, with odds being highest at intermediate elevations and intermediate slopes. When we compared predation sites to nursery sites, odds of a site being a predation were highest at low elevation areas with high visibility and high elevation areas with low visibility likely because of differences in hunting strategies of coyote (Canis latrans) and puma (Puma concolor). Parturition sites were lower in elevation and slope than nursery sites. Understanding selection of parturition sites by adult females and how habitat characteristics at these sites differ from those at predation and nursery sites can provide insight into strategies employed by female desert bighorn sheep and other species during and after parturition to promote neonate survival. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {The integration of multiple uses on public rangeland requires reliable information on patterns of livestock use. We used GPS data and field plot utilization indices to examine cattle selection at the landscape and patch levels, respectively, within a heterogeneous Montane environment of SW Alberta, Canada. We also evaluated factors associated with patterns of summer cattle use, including topographic features, distance to water and roads, as well as forage quantity and quality. Cattle preferred lowland and upland grasslands, while avoiding conifer forests and clear cuts. Selection patterns differed markedly between the landscape and plot scales. At the landscape scale, forage use was related to abiotic factors, primarily slope (β=−0.70) but also distance to water (−0.34) and distance from roads (+0.21). The negative impact of slope was greater than that observed in previous studies, and has implications for identifying primary ranges and deriving sustainable carrying capacities in Montane landscapes. At the plot (feeding patch) scale, forage use was additionally related to biomass availability (β=+0.58), and to a lesser extent crude protein concentration (+0.16), highlighting the importance of forage characteristics in regulating cattle use. Lowland grasslands had the highest biomass and received the greatest forage use (43\% utilization). Low visitation (44\% of plots) and associated forage use (3\% herbage utilization) by cattle within cut blocks, combined with conservative forage use across all habitats (3–43\%), indicate grazing by cattle is consistent with maintaining other uses within this area, including riparian function, native grassland conservation and forest management.},

  abstract = {Temporary emigration was identified some time ago as causing potential problems in capture?recapture studies, and in the last five years approaches have been developed for dealing with special cases of this general problem. Temporary emigration can be viewed more generally as involving transitions to and from an unobservable state, and frequently the state itself is one of biological interest (e.g., ?nonbreeder?). Development of models that permit estimation of relevant parameters in the presence of an unobservable state requires either extra information (e.g., as supplied by Pollock's robust design) or the following classes of model constraints: reducing the order of Markovian transition probabilities, imposing a degree of determinism on transition probabilities, removing state specificity of survival probabilities, and imposing temporal constancy of parameters. The objective of the work described in this paper is to investigate estimability of model parameters under a variety of models that include an unobservable state.

  abstract = {In many savanna ecosystems worldwide, livestock share the landscape and its resources with wildlife. The nature of interactions between livestock and wildlife is a subject of considerable interest and speculation, yet little controlled experimental research has been carried out. Since 1995, we have been manipulating the presence and absence of cattle and large mammalian herbivore wildlife in a Kenyan savanna in order to better understand how different herbivore guilds influence habitat use by specific wildlife species. Using dung counts as a relative assay of herbivore use of the different experimental plots, we found that cattle had a range of effects, mostly negative, on common mesoherbivore species, including both grazers and mixed feeders, but did not have significant effects on megaherbivores. The effect of cattle on most of the mesoherbivore species was contingent on both the presence of megaherbivores and rainfall. In the absence of megaherbivores, wild mesoherbivore dung density was 36\% lower in plots that they shared with cattle than in plots they used exclusively, whereas in the presence of megaherbivores, wild mesoherbivore dung density was only 9\% lower in plots shared with cattle than plots used exclusively. Cattle appeared to have a positive effect on habitat use by zebra (a grazer) and steinbuck (a browser) during wetter periods of the year but a negative effect during drier periods. Plots to which cattle had access had lower grass and forb cover than plots from which they were excluded, while plots to which megaherbivores had access had more grass cover but less forb cover. Grass cover was positively correlated with zebra and oryx dung density while forb cover was positively correlated with eland dung density. Overall these results suggest that interactions between livestock and wildlife are contingent on rainfall and herbivore assemblage and represent a more richly nuanced set of interactions than the longstanding assertion that cattle simply compete with (grazing) wildlife. Specifically, rainfall and megaherbivores seemed to moderate the negative effects of cattle on some mesoherbivore species. Even if cattle tend to reduce wildlife use of the landscape, managing simultaneously for livestock production (at moderate levels) and biodiversity conservation is possible.},

The effects of parity and body condition of the dam, the duration of parturition, the time spent licking the calf, the sex and birth weight of the calf were also analyzed. Neonatal salivary cortisol concentrations were influenced neither by factors related to the dam (parity, body condition) nor the calf (sex, birth weight). The duration of parturition and the time spent licking the calf also had no effect on salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol concentrations increased rapidly after delivery in both groups to reach their peak levels at 45 and 60~min after delivery in EUT and DYS calves, respectively supporting that the birth process means considerable stress for calves and the immediate postnatal period also appears to be stressful for newborn calves. DYS calves exhibited higher salivary cortisol concentrations compared to EUT ones for 0 (P\,=\,0.022), 15 (P\,=\,0.016), 30 (P\,=\,0.007), 45 (P\,=\,0.003), 60 (P\,=\,0.001) and 120~min (P\,=\,0.001), and for 24~h (P\,=\,0.040), respectively. Peak levels of salivary cortisol and the cortisol release into saliva calculated as AUC were higher in DYS than in EUT calves for the 48-h of the sampling period (P\,=\,0.009 and P\,=\,0.003, respectively). The greater magnitude of saliva cortisol levels in DYS calves compared to EUT ones suggest that difficult parturition means severe stress for bovine neonates and salivary cortisol could be an opportunity for non-invasive assessment of stress during the early neonatal period in cattle.},

  abstract = {In late 1987 cattle were removed from the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (NCA) in southeastern Arizona (U.S.A.). We monitored vegetation density and abundance of birds during the breeding season during 1986-1990 in riparian, mesquite grassland, and Chihuahuan desert-scrub communities in the NCA. The density of herbaceous vegetation increased four- to six-fold in riparian and mesquite grassland communities. Little change occurred in herbaceous vegetation in desert scrub, or in the density of shrubs or trees in any of the communities. Of 61 bird species for which sufficient data were collected, mean detections per kilometer increased for 42 species, 26 significantly, and decreased for 19 species, 8 significantly. The number of individuals of all avian species detected on surveys increased each year from 103/kilometer in 1986 to 221/kilometer in 1991, an average annual increase of 23\% (p {$<$} 0.001).

  abstract = {In late 1987 cattle were removed from the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (NCA) in southeastern Arizona (U.S.A.). We monitored vegetation density and abundance of birds during the breeding season during 1986-1990 in riparian, mesquite grassland, and Chihuahuan desert-scrub communities in the NCA. The density of herbaceous vegetation increased four- to six-fold in riparian and mesquite grassland communities. Little change occurred in herbaceous vegetation in desert scrub, or in the density of shrubs or trees in any of the communities. Of 61 bird species for which sufficient data were collected, mean detections per kilometer increased for 42 species, 26 significantly, and decreased for 19 species, 8 significantly. The number of individuals of all avian species detected on surveys increased each year from 103/kilometer in 1986 to 221/kilometer in 1991, an average annual increase of 23\% (p {$<$} 0.001). The largest increases occurred in riparian species, open-cup nesters, Neotropical migrants, and insectivores. Species of the Chihuahuan desert-scrub, in which vegetation changed the least, showed the smallest increases.

  abstract = {Background In many areas, livestock are grazed within wolf (Canis lupus) range. Predation and harassment of livestock by wolves creates conflict and is a significant challenge for wolf conservation. Wild prey, such as elk (Cervus elaphus), perform anti-predator behaviors. Artificial selection of cattle (Bos taurus) might have resulted in attenuation or absence of anti-predator responses, or in erratic and inconsistent responses. Regardless, such responses might have implications on stress and fitness. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared elk and cattle anti-predator responses to wolves in southwest Alberta, Canada within home ranges and livestock pastures, respectively. We deployed satellite- and GPS-telemetry collars on wolves, elk, and cattle (n = 16, 10 and 78, respectively) and measured seven prey response variables during periods of wolf presence and absence (speed, path sinuosity, time spent head-up, distance to neighboring animals, terrain ruggedness, slope and distance to forest). During independent periods of wolf presence (n = 72), individual elk increased path sinuosity (Z = −2.720, P = 0.007) and used more rugged terrain (Z = −2.856, P = 0.004) and steeper slopes (Z = −3.065, P = 0.002). For cattle, individual as well as group behavioral analyses were feasible and these indicated increased path sinuosity (Z = −2.720, P = 0.007) and decreased distance to neighbors (Z = −2.551, P = 0.011). In addition, cattle groups showed a number of behavioral changes concomitant to wolf visits, with variable direction in changes. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest both elk and cattle modify their behavior in relation to wolf presence, with potential energetic costs. Our study does not allow evaluating the efficacy of anti-predator behaviors, but indicates that artificial selection did not result in their absence in cattle. The costs of wolf predation on livestock are often compensated considering just the market value of the animal killed. However, society might consider refunding some additional costs (e.g., weight loss and reduced reproduction) that might be associated with the changes in cattle behaviors that we documented.},

  abstract = {Ecological disturbance is a driving force that structures ecosystems and shapes landscape pattern. Wildfire is a widespread form of ecological disturbance, and in some vegetation communities fires are increasing in extent and severity. Across the gradient of fire severity, fire can have both positive and negative effects on animals, where some species require mature climax vegetation conditions and other species select for early successional stages. However, further work is necessary to understand how large mammalian herbivore and carnivore populations respond to the gradient of fire severity. The overall objective of this research was to understand the relative roles of fire, landscape, and human factors across the gradient of fire severity on occupancy and/or relative habitat use of large herbivores (i.e., elk and mule deer) and carnivores (i.e., black bear, mountain lion, and gray wolf) seven years post fire. We predicted that animals would increase use of areas characterized by higher fire severity (moderate, moderate/high, or high fire severity) and heterogeneity, where food resources were expected to be greatest. In addition, road density could either increase or decrease animal use of areas, where some animals might increase use near roads due to increased forage along roadsides or decrease use due to higher human activity. Remote wildlife (RW) cameras sampled the gradient of fire severity seven years post a large mixed-severity wildfire (Wallow Fire, year 2011, 2,177~km2) in the White Mountains of Arizona, USA. We evaluated RW camera data using single-species occupancy and Royle-Nichols (relative habitat use) models. As predicted, large mammals (black bear, elk, mountain lion, mule deer, and wolves) exhibited high occupancy and/or habitat use in relation to higher levels of fire severity and/or fire heterogeneity, which was likely related to bottom-up factors related to increased food resources. Some species (black bear and elk) also exhibited relatively high use of unburned forest. Elk reduced use of areas with higher road density, likely to avoid human activity, whereas mule deer increased use of areas with high road density. Mixed-severity wildfire may provide important resources, including pulses of food in early successional forests. Thus, allowing fire-adapted forests to experience mixed-severity wildfire is predicted to benefit some large herbivore and carnivore populations. If high occupancy and/or habitat use by wildlife in areas experiencing higher fire severity and heterogeneity translates into increased populations of animals, wildfire might be beneficial to humans, focal wildlife populations, and fire-adapted ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Virtual fencing (VF) has the potential to revolutionise control of livestock movement. Cattle can associate an audio cue with a mild electrical shock. This study investigates individual animal learning with VF collars, and if training time can be reduced using a visual cue (VC). The experiment utilised dog training collars fitted in Moo Monitors. 12 non-lactating dairy cows were subjected to one of 2 treatments: 1) Virtual Fence (VF) only 2) visual cue with VF (VC). Habituation to the laneway, pellets and manual collars occurred 2 x per day for 4 days prior to testing. Testing was performed in a laneway for 4 days. A VF line was set before a feed trough with pellets at the end of the laneway, and moved 10m closer to the holding yard each day for 3 days. Cows received an audio cue for 1 sec at the fence line. If they kept moving forward they received a mildly aversive electric shock. After 3 tests the VC was removed and the test repeated. Animal behaviour, and number of cues received was recorded. The visual cue reduced the number of times cows tested the fence line, with VC cows receiving less cues (mean 2.13) than VF cows (mean 4) overall (P=0.007). The number of cues reduced with each test (P{$<$}0.001), however increased with removal of the VC. The VC group received the most cues when the VC was removed (P{$<$}0.001). There is variation in response and learning of a VF, and results indicate that a visual cue is does not improve learning of associated cues.},

Cattle (Bos taurus) are less adapted to graze individual plant parts (leaves vs. stems) selectively than are sheep (Ovis aries), goats (Capra hircus), or horses (Equis caballus). Diet preference differs among animal types and this may influence botanical composition and productivity of the sward. An example reported from grazing white clover (Trifolium repens L.)-ryegrass (Lolium spp.) pastures showed that lambs consumed greater portions of white clover and smaller portions of grass and dead material than calves. The diet selected by goat kids was intermediate between that selected by calves and lambs. Different grazing intensities may change the morphology of plant growth. Animals may affect pasture composition and growth from treading and through their deposits of dung and urine. Generally, legumes are less resistant to treading than grasses. On P-deficient soils, cattle dung tends to promote legume growth and N in the urine promotes grass growth. Thiamine from herbivore saliva deposited during grazing may promote subsequent regrowth of grasses. Incorporation of animal defoliation in the early phases of forage evaluation is recommended for characterizing plant responses to grazing livestock.},

  abstract = {[Management of sympatric ungulates on multiple use lands requires knowledge of how species exploit resources available to them. We examined seasonal food habits, dietary overlap, and dietary quality of sympatric feral horses (Equus caballus), cattle (Bos taurus),, and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in south-eastern Oregon from May 1979 through March 1981. Seasonal diets of each ungulate species were determined by microhistological analysis of feces. At least 88\% of the mean annual diets of horses and cattle consisted of grasses. Principal species consumed by these ungulates were bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) J.G.Smith), bearded bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum (Pursh) Scribn. \& Smith), and Thurber needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana Piper). Because dietary overlap between horses and cattle was high each season (62-78\%), we concluded a strong potential existed for exploitative competition under conditions of limited forage availability. Pronghorn diets consisted largely of woody sagebrush (Artemisia) species in fall and winter, and a mixture of forbs in spring and summer. Dietary overlap between horses and pronghorn varied from 7\% (summer) to 26\% (winter). Overlap between cattle and pronghorn varied from 8\% (winter) to 25\% (spring). These lower levels of overlap indicate a wider buffer between noncompetitive coexistence and exploitative competition. Pronghorn generally selected diets containing higher levels of crude protein (CP) and lower levels of acid-detergent fiber (ADF) than horses or cattle. We observed few differences in seasonal dietary quality between horses and cattle.]},

There are two major hypotheses to explain their co-existence, but few comparative data are available to test them. The first postulates that the very different functioning of their digestive tracts leads to fundamentally different patterns of use of grasses of different fibre contents. The second postulates resource partitioning through the use of different plant species. As domestic horses and cattle are used widely in Europe for the management of conservation areas, particularly in wetlands, a good knowledge of their foraging behaviour and comparative nutrition is necessary. 2 In this paper we describe resource-use by horses and cattle in complementary studies in two French wetlands. Horses used marshes intensively during the warmer seasons; both species used grasslands intensively throughout the year; cattle used forbs and shrubs much more than horses. Niche breadth was similar and overlap was high (Kulczinski’s index 0·58–0·77). Horses spent much more time feeding on short grass than cattle. These results from the two sites indicate strong potential for competition. 3 Comparative daily food intake, measured in the field during this study for the first time, was 63\% higher in horses (144 gDM kg W−0·75 day−1) than in cattle (88 gDM kg W−0·75 day−1). Digestibility of the cattle diets was a little higher, but daily intake of digestible dry matter (i.e. nutrient extraction) in all seasons was considerably higher in horses (78 gDM kg W−0·75 day−1) than in cattle (51 gDM kg W−0·75 day−1). When food is limiting, horses should outcompete cattle in habitats dominated by grasses because their functional response is steeper; under these circumstances cattle will require an ecological refuge for survival during winter, woodland or shrubland with abundant dicotyledons. 4 Horses are a good tool for plant management because they remove more vegetation per unit body weight than cattle, and use the most productive plant communities and plant species (especially graminoids) to a greater extent. They feed closer to the ground, and maintain a mosaic of patches of short and tall grass that contributes to structural diversity at this scale. Cattle use broadleaved plants to a greater extent than horses, and can reduce the rate of encroachment by certain woody species.},

Inter-individual variation in behavioral traits (personality) and correlation among behavioral traits (behavioral syndromes), can influence empirical estimates of population size and structure, models of resource selection and population dynamics, harvest and control in wildlife and fisheries populations, population response to disturbance and novel environments, and the success of reintroductions. Despite the important role that personality and behavioral syndromes play in the ecology and dynamics of wildlife populations, a disconnect between basic and applied research realms continues. While the concept of animal personalities and their role in ecology and evolution is increasingly embraced in the animal behavior, ecology, and evolutionary biology literature, it is less represented in applied wildlife management and conservation literature. We identify 10 research foci, often considered the domain of applied wildlife management and conservation, summarize examples of how these research domains may be influenced by personality and behavioral syndromes, and outline potential implications. We suggest that a focus on individuals in wildlife conservation study can bridge the gap between basic and applied research and incorporate knowledge from both realms towards more effective management, conservation, and recovery of populations.},

Despite the important role that personality and behavioral syndromes play in the ecology and dynamics of wildlife populations, a disconnect between basic and applied research realms continues. While the concept of animal personalities and their role in ecology and evolution is increasingly embraced in the animal behavior, ecology, and evolutionary biology literature, it is less represented in applied wildlife management and conservation literature. We identify 10 research foci, often considered the domain of applied wildlife management and conservation, summarize examples of how these research domains may be influenced by personality and behavioral syndromes, and outline potential implications. We suggest that a focus on individuals in wildlife conservation study can bridge the gap between basic and applied research and incorporate knowledge from both realms towards more effective management, conservation, and recovery of populations.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare foraging behavior of mature Raramuri Criollo (RC, heritage breed) and Angus Hereford crossbred (AH, commercial breed) cows grazing Chihuahuan Desert rangeland during summer and winter in three consecutive years. Movement, activity, and spatial distribution variables were calculated from 10-min interval GPS positions of 5–11 randomly selected cows of each breed. Thirteen pasture pixel attributes were used to analyze grazing utilization and selection patterns of both breeds. Statistical mixed models were used to determine the effects of breed and season on all foraging response variables. Spatial regression analysis was used to examine resource utilization. Compared to AH, RC cows traveled farther at higher velocity rates, spent less time resting, more time grazing and traveling, explored larger areas as individuals, and exhibited lower herd cohesion. The RC herd explored more grazing patches (30-m pixel) overall and exhibited lower patch residence times in winter, a foraging strategy linked with lighter environmental footprint. During summer, similar pixel variables explained re-visitation rates of cows of both breeds. Both breeds avoided areas far from water, but RC cows showed higher avoidance of pixels farther out from a drinker during the dormant season. RC cows appeared to exhibit a keener ability to select patches with differing surface temperature, and greenness compared to AH counterparts. RC cows showed higher preference for pixels with high shrub density than AH counterparts in summer. During the dormant season, AH cows exhibited a strong preference for black grama patches, a species with high ecological value, and higher avoidance of patches with high density of other grasses. Differences in foraging behavior documented in this study support the hypothesis that RC cattle could impose a lighter footprint on desert rangeland relative to commonly raised commercial beef cattle. Topographical constraints, particularly steep slopes and far distances to water, have persistently challenged livestock distribution globally. Information gained from global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices have accelerated knowledge of cattle (Bos taurus) use of complex topography to potentially challenge established guidelines. In northern Wyoming, USA, we deployed 5 GPS collars on multiparous Salers cows with calves from July to November 2018–2019. Cattle rotated between 2 contrasting rangeland pastures: the Basin pasture (Foothills Shrublands and Low Mountains ecoregion; mean slope of 17.7\% (range: 0.87–111.01\%)) and Mountain pasture (transitioning to Absaroka-Gallatin Volcanic Mountain ecoregion; mean slope of 24.4\% (range: 0.26–125.11\%)). We estimated mean and maximum slope use and distances from water, along with daily distances traveled for each GPS-collared cow per pasture per year. We also generated utilization distributions with Brownian bridge movement models to compare mean slope and distances to water among quartiles of predicted use, and compared stocking rate adjustments per pasture between standard and GPS location derived methods. Mean daily distance traveled was 5126.5 km and 5011.6 km in the Basin and Mountain pastures, respectively, and average distance to water was {$<$}1.65 km. Cattle use was concentrated on gentler slopes than the average slope of the pasture. Mean and maximum slope use was 17.5\% (9.9°) and 68.2\% (34.3°) respectively in the Basin pasture and 8.9\% (5.1°) and 57.1\% (29.7°) in the Basin pasture. Compared to standard methods, GPS-derived grazeable area calculations suggested that there was less grazeable area in the Basin pasture but more in the Mountain pasture. Our results indicate that cattle adapted to mountainous terrain may challenge established guidelines for slope use, but not for distance to water. Such information could influence grazeable area calculations, stocking rates, and water development. Management of areas invaded by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) continues to be one of the greatest challenges for US Great Basin ecosystems. Targeted cattle grazing in the fall and winter has shown positive results as a management tool to reduce dormant fine fuel biomass within cheatgrass-invaded areas, but management of targeted grazing within large pastures can be challenging. We evaluated the use of strategically placed liquid protein supplement stations over a 4-wk period in the fall to focus cattle grazing along a linear transect stretching away from water to reduce residual cheatgrass biomass on a production-scale, working ranch from 2014 to 2017. Liquid protein supplement stations were moved approximately 1 km farther from water during each week of the study, eventually reaching 4 km from a single water source. Global Positioning System−tracked cattle visited supplement stations 52\% ± 4\% of the days during the study period and were within 100 m of the supplement station transect line 17.7\% ± 2.6\% of the time: more than 3 × greater (P = 0.07) than random locations (5.1\% ± 2.6\%). Week of the study and the subsequent supplement distance from water did not influence the number of visits cattle made to supplement. The duration that cattle remained at supplement was greater in wk 4, when supplement was placed 4 km from water, compared with wk 1 and 2, when the supplement was 1 and 2 km from water, respectively. At the conclusion of grazing, utilization along the supplement station transect averaged 66.0\% ± 5.7\% and did not differ between supplement stations at 1 km, 3 km, or 4 km from water. Strategic supplementation provides a valuable tool to target cattle grazing at specific locations within cheatgrass-invaded systems to reduce fine fuel buildup during the dormant season. A key challenge of precision grazing systems is identifying behavior anomalies associated with situations of reduced animal production and wellbeing. We determined typical ranges of diel variation of movement and activity patterns of steers on rangeland to identify metrics that could serve as sensitive indicators of behavior anomalies. Seventeen Raramuri Criollo or Criollo crossbred yearling steers weighing 318 ± 9.3 kg (winter; W) or 358 ± 8.4 kg (late summer; LS) were fitted with GPS collars that recorded animal location at 5-min intervals. Steers grazed a 3,215-ha rangeland pasture for approximately 67 d in W or LS of 2016 and 2017. GPS data were used to derive 22 commonly monitored behavior variables. Means and day-to-day variation (CV\%) of all behavior metrics were calculated for each animal as well as linear correlations between the CV of each behavior and ADG. Daily time spent resting or grazing exhibited the least day-to-day variation in both W and LS (CV resting =10.8 and 9.9\%, respectively; CV grazing =13.8 and 14.8\%, respectively); predawn area explored (CV =240.8\%) and time spent at drinkers (CV =336.6\%) exhibited the most daily variation in W and LS, respectively. During W, increasing day-to-day variation in daytime distance traveled and area explored, as well as daily time spent traveling were associated with increasing ADG (r = 0.56 to 0.58; P {$<$} 0.05). In LS, steers with greater CV for 24-h area explored, time spent traveling, or daytime distance traveled tended to gain less weight (r =-0.77 to -0.84; P {$<$} 0.01), while steers with more flexible 24 hour path sinuosity tended to gain more weight (r = 0.93; P {$<$} 0.01). Behavior metrics more closely associated with forage intake processes, such as daily time spent grazing or resting, exhibited lowest diel variation levels and could be used to diagnose non-normal behavior of cattle on rangeland. Livestock distribution in extensive rangelands of North America can present management challenges to land managers. Understanding the role of topography on livestock distribution, within and across diverse rangeland ecosystems, could provide land managers valuable information for adaptive management of livestock to address both conservation and production goals from these ecosystems. Here, we examine the influence of topography on grazing distribution unevenness and intensity of use of beef cattle in seven rangeland ecosystems spanning arid, semiarid, and subtropical environments. We focused on grazing distribution during the late growing season (summer and autumn) periods when topographic variation in rangelands is more coupled to low and nonuniform availability of high-quality forage. Pasture size and water sources strongly influence grazing distribution across ecosystems. High unevenness of grazing occurred in pastures with extensive distances to water, low stock density, and more rugged topography. Conversely, more uniform grazing distribution occurred in smaller, well-watered pastures that support higher stock density (animals per unit area) and gentler terrain. Comparison of two topographic indices, topographic wetness index and topographic position class index, in terms of their ability to predict cattle grazing distribution, revealed that categorical topographic position classes were more effective. For most arid and semiarid rangelands, livestock grazing distributions showed affinities for lowlands and flat plains compared with open slopes and uplands. In contrast to drier rangelands, livestock grazing distributions exhibited preference for upland and sloped areas of subtropical pastures, as low-lying areas with water-inundation likely curtailed selection. Across these diverse rangeland ecosystems of North America, results provide benchmark information on livestock grazing distribution to formulate improvements in adaptive management and decision making and incorporate technological advancements in precision livestock management to integrate abiotic environmental information with spatial movements of livestock and temporal vegetation dynamics. •Rangeland-based livestock raising is the only agricultural production system that maintains native plant communities, providing ecosystem services in the same space as food and fiber production.•Annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) underlies forage production and multiple ecosystem services. ANPP is highly variable in rangelands in the western United States, across the landscape, from year to year, and within a growing season. Variability is also increasing as the climate changes.•Grazing management decisions that determine when, where, and how much of ANPP is consumed by livestock, including stocking rate decisions, can ultimately determine rangeland health and the future sustainability of livestock production and provision of ecosystem services.•Yet managers' access to data on available forage and its variability is limited, and existing field methods to quantify forage production accurately require extensive sampling and are prone to errors or bias.•A variety of remotely sensed data sources exist to help characterize forage availability and how it has varied spatially and temporally over the last 30 or more years, as well as other datasets that can estimate available forage and inaccessible terrain for livestock.•We discuss the need for a state-of-the-art decision support tool that integrates available remote-sensing data on forage availability with land managers’ knowledge of local needs and information for managers to access to the depth and breadth of information they need to sustainably manage grazing under variable and changing conditions.•Such a decision support tool could help land managers better manage rangeland ecosystems with flexible stocking rates and adaptive grazing management opportunities that adjust to variations in ANPP, leading to increased regional and site-specific rangeland resilience.},

  abstract = {Since 1959, the U.S. Congress has legislated the treatment and management of wild horses (Equus ferus caballus) and burros (E. asinus; WHB). While the legislation has ensured WHB a place as western rangeland icons, subsequent congressional actions, in response to public lobbying, have limited federal managers’ ability to manage WHB populations under the U.S. public land multiple-use doctrine. Federal land managers tasked with managing for multiple and competing interests on public lands of the western United States must not only consider WHB habitat requirements, but also wildlife species diversity and livestock grazing. Developing multiple-use management strategies while fulfilling other mandates will require balancing rather than maximizing a single resource use or user. Grazing by wild and domestic animals can modify plant community composition and structure, and overabundant populations negatively impact rangeland–watershed function and wildlife habitats. Negative effects on wildlife may include avoidance of water sources by wildlife, forage loss and altered plant communities, altered bird communities, and impacts to soils and insects. Effective management for riparian and rangeland health includes managing both the abundance and the distribution of large grazers. Unless large grazers (including WHB) are managed, range condition and wildlife habitat are at risk. While livestock can be moved and removed, and big game can be hunted, the management and removal of WHB populations continues to face strong public opposition. The management of WHB under the federal land multiple-use doctrine will require implementing innovative, diverse, and tough management strategies founded in the biological and social sciences. This special issue of Human–Wildlife Interactions explores these issues in depth. This paper frames the context in which WHB management must be achieved under the U.S. public land multiple-use doctrine.},

Before and during the study, subjects performed ramp-protocol tests, running and cycling, to determine Aerobic (AeT) and Anaerobic Thresholds (AnT) through gas-exchange analysis. For swimming, subjects performed a graded lactate test to determine AeT and AnT. Training was subsequently controlled by heart rate during each training session over 18 weeks. Training and the competition were both quantified based on the cumulative time spent in 3 intensity zones: zone 1 (low intensity; AnT). Most of training time was spent in zone 1 (68±14\%) whereas the Ironman competition was primarily performed in zone 2 (59±22\%). Significant inverse correlations were found between both total training time and training time in zone 1 versus performance time in competition (r= -0.69, and -0.92, respectively). In contrast, there was a moderate positive correlation between total training time in zone 2 and performance time in competition (r=0.53) and a strong positive correlation between \% of total training time in zone 2 and performance time in competition (r=0.94). While athletes perform with heart rate mainly in zone 2, better performances are associated with more training time spent in zone 1. A high amount of cycling training in zone 2 may contribute to poorer overall performance.},

Managers are concerned about the impact of increased recreation on desert bighorn sheep in Canyonlands National Park (NP), Utah, USA, where visitation increased 325\% from 1979 to 1994. We compared behavioral responses of sheep to recreational activity between a low visitor use area and a high visitor use area during 1993 and 1994 by observing behavioral responses, distances moved, and duration of responses to vehicles, mountain bikers, and humans on foot. Hikers caused the most severe responses in desert bighorn sheep (animals fled in 61\% of encounters), followed by vehicles (17\% fled) and mountain bikers (6\% fled), apparently because hikers were more likely to be in unpredictable locations and often directly approached sheep. We observed considerable individual heterogeneity in responses of bighorn sheep to the greater human use: some animals lived close to the road corridor and were apparently habituated to the human activities, but other animals avoided the road corridor. In the high-use area, we observed 3 radiocollared sheep that lived closer to the road than expected and found evidence of fewer responses to vehicles by females in spring, less response time of all sheep to vehicles in spring, and fewer responses to mountain bikers compared to the low-use area. Overall, there was an avoidance of the road corridor by most other bighorn sheep in the high-use area where all animals, on average, were found 39\% farther from roads (490 ± 19 m vs. 354 ± 36 m) than in the low-use area. This avoidance of the road corridor by some animals represented 15\% less use of potential suitable habitat in the high-use area over the low-use area. Increased sensitivity to hikers in the high-use area was suggested by a greater responsiveness by males in autumn and greater distance fled by females in spring. Responses of bighorn sheep were greater when human activity approached at the same elevation, when sheep were moving or standing, when female interactions occurred in spring and summer and male interactions occurred in autumn, and when sheep were farther from escape terrain. We recommend managers confine hikers to designated trails during spring lambing and the autumn rut in desert bighorn sheep habitat.},

  abstract = {As gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations have expanded in the western United States, wolf depredation of domestic livestock has increased. Concomitantly, wildlife managers are seeking management tools to mitigate wolf–livestock conflicts and enhance stakeholder support for conservation efforts. Range Rider Programs (RRPs) have emerged as a nonlethal management strategy that advocates the use of increased human surveillance of livestock herds in areas occupied by wolves to reduce wolf–livestock conflicts. However, little information is available about the scope of contemporary northern Rocky Mountain (NRM) RRPs or participant perceptions about the potential for the programs to mitigate these conflicts. We conducted semistructured phone and personal interviews with 51 participants from 17 RRPs in Montana, Oregon, and Washington during January to April 2014 and October 2014 to January 2015 to develop a typology of NRM RRPs and assess participant perceptions of current programs. Although the RRPs we studied varied in context, program focus, and scale, they shared similar organizational components that included a sponsor; collaboration among several organizations; a funding mechanism; a structure that included a supervisor, the landowner(s), and the range rider(s); and a mechanism for stakeholder feedback.

  abstract = {As gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations have expanded in the western United States, wolf depredation of domestic livestock has increased. Concomitantly, wildlife managers are seeking management tools to mitigate wolf–livestock conflicts and enhance stakeholder support for conservation efforts. Range Rider Programs (RRPs) have emerged as a nonlethal management strategy that advocates the use of increased human surveillance of livestock herds in areas occupied by wolves to reduce wolf–livestock conflicts. However, little information is available about the scope of contemporary northern Rocky Mountain (NRM) RRPs or participant perceptions about the potential for the programs to mitigate these conflicts. We conducted semistructured phone and personal interviews with 51 participants from 17 RRPs in Montana, Oregon, and Washington during January to April 2014 and October 2014 to January 2015 to develop a typology of NRM RRPs and assess participant perceptions of current programs. Although the RRPs we studied varied in context, program focus, and scale, they shared similar organizational components that included a sponsor; collaboration among several organizations; a funding mechanism; a structure that included a supervisor, the landowner(s), and the range rider(s); and a mechanism for stakeholder feedback. We identified 3 unique RRP versions based on the primary focus of the programs: 1) livestock monitoring, 2) wolf surveillance, and 3) livestock herding. Although participants identified a number of benefits (e.g., increased information about wolf activity, extra herd supervision, rapid carcass identification), they also identified challenges that affected program sustainability.

  abstract = {Since the 1800s managed grasslands and shrublands of the arid American Southwest have been grazed predominantly by cattle originally bred for temperate climates in northern Europe. A heritage breed, the criollo cattle, has survived in northern Mexico for more than 400 years under desert-like conditions of low and variable rainfall, hot temperatures in the growing season, and both spatially and temporally scarce levels of primary production. We tested the hypothesis that the heritage breed has a broader spatial foraging distribution under harsh environmental conditions, and that its distribution is driven by environmental variables which differ from those that control the distribution of the introduced European breed. Movements of individual criollo and Angus breed animals were monitored autonomously in the northern Chihuahuan desert of southern New Mexico, USA. Georeferenced foraging locations acquired at 5-minute intervals for each animal were fit to a logistic regression using environmental factors as predictors. In the spring, when forage availability was high and more uniformly distributed across the landscape, animal foraging patterns were similar for both breeds. In the fall when forage availability was low and non-uniformly distributed, the two breeds exhibited very different foraging patterns: heritage animals foraged across a much larger spatial extent whereas their domestic counterparts remained in close proximity to the permanent source of water. These differences in foraging behavior driven by environmental variables have important implications for sustainability of rangelands in spatially and temporally variable environments. Heritage breeds of animals that are generalist foragers during unfavorable conditions can reduce environmental impacts compared to more recently introduced breeds.},

The grazing seasons, in replicate pastures, were from 15 July-9 August, 15 June-26 July, and 15 June-2 August in 1980,1981, and 1982, respectively. Daily observations were made of radio-telemetry collared cattle (3 per pasture). Cattle dispersion was constrained by the spatial distribution of water and slope. Across 3 seasons, 77\% of observed use was within 366 m of water. Approximately 65\% of the land area WPSbeyond 723 m from water and sustained only 12\% of observed use. Cattle concentrated use (79\%) on slopes less than 7\%. Consequently 35\% of the area, on or surrounded by slopes {$>$}lO\%, received only 7\% of observed use. Loamy, grszable woodland and wetlandfsubirrigated range sites were most preferred and accounted for over 65\% of observed use while occupying less than 35\% of the land area. Overall, course upland, very shallow and shallow loamy sites were not preferred; however, site preference varied as areas further from water were utilized. Observed usewassigniticantly (P},

Rangeland health assessments consist of evaluating how well ecological processes, such as the water cycle, energy flow, and nutrient cycling, are functioning at a site. Maintained ecological functions provide support for specific plant and animal communities (Pellant et al. 2005) and ensure a flow of ecosystem services. The most commonly used protocol to assess US rangelands has become the Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (IIRH) assessment (Pellant et al. 2005; Pyke et al. 2002). Rangeland health assessments use 17 indicators to rate 3 attributes of rangeland health that integrate soil and plant indicators together with other abiotic factors into one scientifically tested assessment tool. Attributes rated as part of rangeland health assessments are soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity (Pellant et al. 2005). Additionally, rangeland health protocols have been tested across a broad range of ecosystems and are already in use by thousands of individuals worldwide. Other common tools used to evaluate rangelands include similarity indices and trend studies, which can be used alone or in conjunction with the rangeland health assessment methodology.

  abstract = {Year-round mixed-species grazing at low densities in large-scale pasture systems has become a popular conservation concept as it is assumed to maintain the valuable biodiversity of semi-open cultural landscapes. This study aims to elucidate which vegetation types are preferentially grazed by cattle and sheep and whether the grazing animals change their preferences through the seasons so that year-round grazing leads to a utilization of all habitats. Additionally, we wanted to determine the main factors underlying the site use patterns of the animals. The study was conducted on 180ha of a nature reserve and former military training area in northern Germany from January to October. Within this area, the positions of one cattle herd and one sheep flock were simultaneously recorded every 5min using the global positioning system (GPS). For this purpose, we fitted one GPS collar alternately to three different cows and another to three different sheep. If the position of a collared animal had changed more than 6m but less than 100m within 5min grazing was assumed based on a validation of these thresholds by direct observation. Using a geographic information system, we analysed the location data with regard to vegetation characteristics, altitude, and distance from fences, water sources, and a sheep shed. For each month, we determined Ivlev's electivity index of both herbivore species in relation to eight broad vegetation types. We used multiple linear regression to create models that describe the grazing frequencies in the grid cells of the area depending on parameters of those grid cells and their spatial position. Cattle preferred moist and productive habitats, whereas sheep preferred dry and nutrient-poor habitats. Only when feed was in extremely short supply, the animals switched to sites they had previously avoided. Differences in the spatial preferences of the two species were more marked than seasonal changes. Spatial demands of cattle and sheep were largely complementary. Grazing sites with better water availability (i.e. lower distance from the drinking trough and ponds) were significantly preferred by cattle. The sheep preferred grazing sites close to their shed. Our results show that only a combination of different herbivores guarantees that all habitats of such a large low-intensity pasture are grazed and thus are kept in a management status favourable to conservation. However, the positioning of drinking troughs, fences, and sheds should be carefully considered as these facilities seriously influence the site use of the animals.},

Five of 9 state agencies that responded directly estimated population size for ≥1 ungulate species from abundance estimates (i.e., conducted actual animal counts within a defined sampling frame). Many states estimated population size indirectly, usually through post-hoc life-table methods based on herd composition estimates. Nonrandom sampling designs were used more commonly than were random sampling designs by most agencies and for most species. Few agencies designed surveys to estimate ungulate survival. Survey costs in 1998 (by state) ranged from \$440,000 to \$1,700,000/year. Most surveys could be improved by incorporating direct population estimation methods and randomized sampling designs.}

  abstract = {1. Competition between livestock and wild ungulates is commonly perceived to occur on shared rangelands. In the Henry Mountains (HM) of Utah, a free-ranging population of bison Bison bison has raised concerns among ranchers holding grazing permits on these public lands. Bison are the most conspicuous potential competitors with cattle, but lagomorphs (mainly jackrabbits Lepus californicus) are also abundant in this area. The local ranching community is applying political pressure on state and federal agencies to resolve 'the bison problem', but the relative grazing impacts of bison, cattle and lagomorphs have not previously been quantified. 2. We constructed 40 grazing exclosures (each 5-95 m²) in the conflict area: 20 excluded bison + cattle ('partial') and 20 excluded bison + cattle 4-lagomorphs ('full'). All exclosures, each with a paired open reference plot, were monitored for 1 year, and above-ground plant production was measured. GPS telemetry (bison) and scheduled grazing (cattle) allowed visitation to be quantified for each ungulate species based on the number of 'animal days' in the area. Rancher perceptions of wildlife-cattle interactions were recorded in a questionnaire survey. 3. Ranchers perceived bison as a high-level competitor with cattle, whereas lagomorphs were perceived as low-level competitors. 4. Grazed reference plots yielded an average (± SE) of 22·7 g m⁻² (± 5·16) of grass, compared to 36·5 g m⁻² (± 7·33) in the partial exclosures and 43·7 g m² (± 7·61) in the full exclosures. Exclusion of large herbivores thus resulted in a 13·8 g ⁻² increase in grass biomass relative to the reference plots (P = 0005), with the additional exclusion of lagomorphs resulting in a further 7·18 g m⁻² increase (P = 0-048). 5. Overall, lagomorphs accounted for 341\%, bison 13-7\% and cattle 52-3\% of the total grass biomass removed by all herbivores on the shared range. 6. Synthesis and applications. Cattle face a greater competitive challenge from lagomorphs than from bison in the study area. This case study illustrates the need for science-based management of social-ecological systems in which even long-term resource users might underestimate the complexities of trophic interactions. Attention should be redirected at the lagomorphs and their main predators, coyotes Canis latrans, which are currently subject to population control. To reduce negative perceptions among local ranchers, options should be explored to incorporate benefit-sharing into the management of the bison population.},

  abstract = {Improper management of cattle near streams can negatively affect the processes that support stream and riparian ecosystems. To judge the success of riparian management strategies, public land management agencies often evaluate two metrics of livestock disturbance, stubble height and streambank alteration. There are concerns associated with how well these disturbance metrics reflect livestock use and incorporate additional effects due to wild ungulates. We sought to address these questions in 39 riparian areas by using time-lapse cameras to estimate ungulate use and then measuring near stream ungulate disturbance in these same reaches. We found daytime measures of livestock use were related to stubble height and streambank alteration. Explaining the variation in the relationship between stubble height and livestock use was improved by incorporating covariates, whereas covariates did little to improve our understanding of streambank alteration. This suggests greater flexibility in how different stream reaches are managed when stubble height is the guideline. As streambank alteration was explained solely by ungulate use, the simplest way to reduce disturbance was to reduce use. In most stream reaches, the additive presence of wild ungulates was minimal but sufficient to be included in the best models describing the effects of ungulate disturbance. On most days, no cattle were seen in the evaluated riparian reaches. Although large groups of cattle ({$>$} 20 individuals) were occasionally observed within riparian areas, they generally occurred in small groups of one to four individuals. Across the riparian reaches we evaluated, cattle presence and density were generally low enough that metrics of livestock disturbance suggested little risk to stream conditions important to aquatic biota. However, there were some riparian areas where cattle stayed too long or occurred in large enough numbers that their use along the streambanks could negatively affect stream habitat conditions.},

The study was conducted on semidesert rangeland in south-central New Mexico. Ambient air temperatures ranged between 7 and 38°C. Relative humidity ranged between 15 and 91\%, with precipitation 49\% above the long-term January–August mean of 147 mm. Four lactating and 4 non-lactating cows were fed an average of 1.4 kg per head day−1 of a 41\% crude protein cottonseed supplement every 3.5 days. Ten similar non-supplemented cows, 5 lactating and 5 non-lactating, were grazed with the supplemented animals in paddocks averaging {$>$}2000 ha in size. To monitor travel, the 18 cows were each bi-pedometered with digital pedometers attached to their front legs. The least square mean travel (± standard error) over the 81-day study period indicated supplemented and non-supplemented cows traveled similar (P{$>$}0.05) distances of 7.7±0.7 and 7.9±0.7 km day−1, respectively. Lactating and non-lactating cows likewise traveled similar (P{$>$}0.05) distances of 7.6±0.7 and 8.2±0.7 km day−1, respectively. Daylight ranged between 14.2 and 13.2 h throughout the study with daily travel decreasing (P{$<$}0.01) at a rate of 0.06±{$<$}0.01 km day−1. Mean daily cow travel was positively correlated (P{$<$}0.01) to both total amount of precipitation received (r=0.37) and mean hours of daylight (r=0.35) during the period in which travel was monitored. Mean daily cow travel was negatively correlated (r=−0.21; P{$<$}0.05) to mean daily relative humidity of the previous sampling period. However, mean daily cow travel was not (P{$>$}0.05) correlated to mean relative humidity of the period in which travel was monitored or to total amount of precipitation received during the previous sampling period. Correlation coefficients were negative (P{$<$}0.01) and ranged between r=−0.37 and r=−0.26 for mean daily cow travel and mean ambient air temperatures (mid-range, minimum and maximum) regardless of sampling period.},

  abstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

  abstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

  abstract = {1 Monitoring red fox Vulpes vulpes abundance is necessary to assess the status and management of this species and to understand predator–prey relationships. Spotlight counts are most often used for this purpose. However, comparisons between regions or over years may be questionable when using encounter rates, i.e. the number of foxes seen per kilometre. We evaluated whether distance-sampling methods, which take account of variation in visibility, could be applied to spotlight counts of foxes along roads and trails. 2 Distance-sampling methods were used at 12 contrasting sites in France in a systematic design with equally spaced transects or points. Line and point transects were simultaneously applied at two sites to find the more precise and efficient method. 3 The number of foxes seen near the centreline was always low, although some foxes may have been missed. A peak of sightings at subsequent intervals from the centreline suggested evasive movements. 4 Despite the low sighting frequency near the centreline, which may reflect a violation of distance-sampling assumptions, a good model fit was obtained for eight out of 12 data sets using a regular 50-m grouping of the distance data. Increasing the first interval to account for evasive movement improved model fit in the four other data sets. Density estimates ranged from 0·39 to 3·54 foxes km−2 (range of coefficient of variation 4·5–24·6\%). 5 Point and line transects resulted in similar density estimates, but point transects were more time consuming and resulted in larger coefficients of variation due to a smaller number of foxes seen by this method. Line transects may therefore produce better estimates of fox numbers. 6 There were few differences among the effective strip width estimates between the 12 sites (range 191–286 m), thus line transect estimates may have a limited advantage over encounter rates. 7 Synthesis and applications. The systematic scheme we applied in this study improved sampling design and variance estimations and should be useful for surveying terrestrial mammals with spotlight counts. However, the location of transects along roads and in open habitats probably induced biased results. Methodological improvements are necessary before spotlight distance sampling can become a routine monitoring tool for foxes.},

Distribution patterns of horses were compared to those of cattle, elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus hemionus and 0. virginianus), and moose (Afces alces) using indices of spatial and habitat use overlap. Horses were more ubiquitous in their distribution than any other ungulate and utilized sites also used by other species. Lack of behavioural interactions and dietary differences suggested ecological separation of horses from deer and moose. Although horses and elk both used dry grasslands during winter and spring, competition for forage was minimal due to the low number of elk present. During spring horses occupied some areas later preferred by cattle but range use was not excessive prior to the turn-out of cattle. There was little contemporaneous spatial overlap of horses and cattle even though their summer diets showed 66\% overlap. Potential for competition appeared highest between horses and cattle but grazing relationships were complex.},

This paper examines the animal unit as an example of a general process of concept design, a process involving multiple options for defining the concept, and multiple objectives and multiple applications for the concept in range management science. Based on this analysis, the animal unit is abstracted as a unit of energy demand independent of interactive considerations of forage or environment. The proposed definition optimizes the utility and universality of the concept by minimizing confounding in the concept's most important applications. The result is a simplified concept that can be used to explicitly express animal equivalences, and can be used in a web of more complex, interactive concepts and models involving human objectives, natural resources, and livestock. The animal unit and animal-unit equivalent are relatively simple examples of synthetic concepts involving communication that are central to the identity of range management science.},

Identifying potential diet overlap among horses, livestock, and wildlife will inform management decisions to optimize multiple interests. To understand dietary relationships, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of microhistological fecal studies for wild horse, beef cattle (Bos spp.), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) diet composition on western rangelands of North America.

  abstract = {Diet composition of free-roaming animals has been persistently difficult to quantify. Fecal DNA (fDNA) metabarcoding is an emerging novel technology to reconstruct botanical composition of diets. Validation studies comparing fDNA metabarcodion to fed diets are lacking. A blind 6-week feeding study using 5 heifers (416–527 kg) fed different diets weekly with fecal samples collected from individuals 7 days after the introduction of each new diet was conducted. Diets were: (1) C3 grass hay (creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus)), (2) C4 grass hay (foxtail millet (Setaria italica), (3) C3 grass hay + C4 grass hay + alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa) (equal 1/3 proportions dry matter, 17.0\%, 30.5\%, and 52.5\% by crude protein contribution, respectively), (4) C3 grass hay + C4 grass hay + alfalfa hay (equal proportions) + minor component of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) leaves (fed at 25 grams per heifer per day equal to 0.29\% by dry matter contribution; crude protein content unknown), (5) alfalfa hay + minor components of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) that included steams, leaves, and seed heads (varying proportions by dry matter ranging from 0.02 to 0.15\% but 0.05\%, 0.04\%, and 0.01\% by crude protein contribution), and (6) alfalfa hay. Single species diets were fed ad libitum. Diets with multiple forage species were fed at metabolic weight-based amounts with minor diet components introduced 2-3 days after major diet components. At the species level, fed diets and fDNA metabarcoding diets were dissimilar due to misidentification of major C3 and C4 diet components. For C3, A. arundinaceus was under the same Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) as Phleum pratense (not present in the C3 sourced hay), so blind identification was initially wrong. For C4, S. italica was identified as Setaria palmifolia, which does not grow in the region. Microscopic evaluation of seeds for both misidentifications verified the correct species identification and the fDNA error. Minor dietary components were detected in only 1 of 5 heifers for all species. Increasing the utility of fDNA metabarcoding for accurately determining the diet composition of free-roaming animals will necessitate: 1) improving the reference library of voucher species specimens, 2) understanding by technical and scientific staff that multiple species may be attributed to the same OTU, and 3) greater verification of fDNA metabarcoding results using field-derived plant composition data, especially in rangeland settings where plant diversity can be intrinsically high.},

  abstract = {More than a quarter of earth’s land surface is used for grazing domestic livestock. Livestock grazing is generally assumed to negatively affect wildlife, however, a number of studies have found positive impacts as well. We conducted an evidence-based review of the existing literature using a series of livestock- and wildlife-related search words to systematically query Google Scholar and Web of Science. A total of 807 sources were included in the final list, including 646 primary sources which reported original data. The majority of studies were conducted in North America (338) or Europe (123), with many fewer from Africa (57), Australia (54), Central/South America (43), or Asia (31). Most studies examined birds (330) and mammals (262), with fewer including reptiles (91) or amphibians (58). We extracted further information from studies that included mammals on positive, negative, and neutral effects of livestock grazing on mammals. We found that livestock change vegetation structure and cover in ways important to small mammals, while ungulates may be affected more by interference competition and changes in forage quantity and quality. Community-level total abundance of small mammals typically declines with grazing. Species richness of small mammals either declines or stays the same, as many studies found a change in species composition from ungrazed to grazed sites while the number of species remained similar. Individual species responses of small mammals vary. Voles, harvest mice, cotton rats, and shrews show consistently negative responses to grazing while deer mice, kangaroo rats, ground squirrels, and lagomorphs show positive or variable responses. In general, species adapted to open habitats are often positively affected by grazing, while species needing denser cover are negatively affected. Studies of wild ungulates are more variable in methodology and quality than those for small mammals. We found more negative (n = 86) than positive (n = 34) ungulate responses overall, however, most studies have been on browsers and mixed feeders, namely deer and elk, and there is little available data for other groups. Although data is limited, several of the grazing species in Africa may show a trend toward positive responses, suggesting possible facilitation. For a number of species, responses varied by season. We find a strong need for additional research on ungulates of varying diets and body sizes, especially in the developing world, and across longer time scales to examine possible tradeoffs between competition and facilitation from livestock.},

  abstract = {Grazing itineraries of herded and free grazing cattle (n=194), goats (n=148), and sheep (n=129) were monitored in a village territory over a 1-year cycle by direct observation of grazing and excretion behaviour and by parallel animal tracking using a Global Positioning System. During the study period, standing and litter biomass of spontaneous vegetation and crop residues was measured repeatedly on sample plots of fields (n=16), fallows (n=15) and rangeland (n=8). Based on a land use map, a Geographic Information System on forage availability was produced for the territory and overlaid with the livestock grazing itineraries. The animals’ behaviour at pasture was related to the forage mass encountered along their daily itineraries in order to analyse the spatial variation in behaviour as influenced by season, livestock species and herd management mode. Maximum daily itinerary lengths were 25km in cattle, 20km in goats and 21km in sheep; itinerary length varied significantly between species, herd management modes and season. Animals spent between 456 and 625min per day on pasture, the grazing day of cattle being longer than that of sheep and goats. Across seasons, all three species spent on average about 60\% of the daily grazing time feeding, 20–26\% walking and 12–20\% resting. The forage mass encountered along the animals’ itineraries was higher than the average amount of forage available in the area. Particularly during the late dry and the rainy season, herding increased the amount of forage on offer to grazing livestock. Throughout the year, 39\% of the observed excretions occurred on cropland, 31\% on rangeland, 20\% on fallows and 10\% in and around settlements; the spatial repartition of excreta deposits differed between herded and free grazing animals, with free grazing animals depositing a higher share of excretions on barren land. The obtained information on the variation of grazing and excretion behaviour with respect to ruminant species, land use type, forage supply, season and herd management can be coupled with quantitative data on feed intake and excreta deposition, in order to compute livestock-mediated nutrient budgets for Sahelian agro-pastoral land use systems.},

Changes in aggregated gross margins are even higher if adaptation policies are in place. However, increasing productivity from climate change leads to deteriorating environmental conditions such as declining plant species richness and landscape appearance. It has to be balanced by mitigation and adaptation policies taking into account effects from the considerable spatial heterogeneity such as revealed by the ILM.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of cottonwood-willow riparian corridors and isolated oases to land birds migrating across southeastern Arizona was evaluated during four spring migrations, 1989 to 1994, based on patterns of species richness, relative abundance, density, and body condition of birds. We surveyed birds in 13 study sites ranging in size and connectivity from small isolated patches to extensive riparian forest, sampled vegetation and insects, and captured birds in mistnets. The continuous band of riparian vegetation along the San Pedro River does not appear to be functioning as a corridor for many migrating species, although it may for a few, namely Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens), Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra), and Northern Rough-winged Swallows (Steldigopteryx serripennis), which account for fewer than 10\% of the individuals migrating through the area. Small, isolated oases hosted more avian species than the corridor sites, and the relative abundances of most migrating birds did not differ between sites relative to size-connectivit. There were few differences in between-year variability in the relative abundances of migrating birds between corridor and oasis sites. Between-year variability decreased with overall abundance of species and was greater for species with breeding ranges that centered north of 50 \textsuperscript{⚬}N latitude. Body condition of birds did not differ relative to the size-connectivity of the capture site, but individuals of species with more northerly breeding ranges had more body fat than species that breed nearby. Peak migration densities of several bird species far exceeded breeding densities reported for the San Pedro River, suggesting that large components of these species were en route migrants. Peak densities of Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) reached 48.0 birds/ha, of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) 33.7 birds/ha, and of Yellow-rumped Warblers (D. coronata) 30.1 birds/ha. Riparian vegetation is limited in extent in the vicinity of our study sites, covering less than 1\% of the landscape. We conclude that all riparian patches in southeastern Arizona are important as stopover sites to en route migrants regardless of their size and degree of isolation or connectivity. In light of potential habitat limitation, the protection of both small, disjunct riparian patches and extensive riverine tracts in western landscape is imperative.},

To explore the effects of species biogeography and habitat affinity on spring migration patterns, we synthesized existing bird abundance and capture data collected in riparian habitats of the borderlands region of the U.S. and Mexico. We determined the importance of geographic factors (longitude and latitude) in explaining variation in abundances and capture rates of 32 longdistance and three short-distance migrant species. Abundances and capture rates of 13 and 11 species, respectively, increased with increasing longitude, and four species’ abundance and capture rates decreased with increasing longitude. Riparian associates, but not nonriparian species, were more abundant in western sites. Their abundance patterns were only weakly influenced by species biogeography. In contrast, biogeography did influence abundance patterns of nonriparian birds, suggesting that they choose the shortest, most direct route between wintering and breeding areas. We hypothesize that riparian obligate birds may, to some degree, adjust their migration routes to maximize time spent in high-quality riparian zones, but they are able to find suitable habitat opportunistically when crossing more hostile landscapes. In contrast, nonriparian birds adhere more closely to a hierarchical model in which the migratory route is determined by biogeographic constraints. Conservation of riparian habitats is necessary to meet future habitat stopover requirements of many western Neotropical migrant birds. We advocate a coordinated research effort to further elucidate patterns of distribution and habitat use so that conservation activities can be focused effectively.},

  abstract = {This review examines the conservation, risk, productivity, viability and acceptability of range management technology as it relates to sustaining rangeland ecosystems specifically in arid and semi-arid climates. The efficiency, cost effectiveness and risk with which rainfall is converted into plant production, and eventually gross farming income, without deterioration of natural resources form the essence of sustainability of rangeland ecosystems in these areas. Range and soil degradation can dramatically influence soil water balance, nutrient cycling, soil loss, production and the economics of a farm unit. Management for long-term sustainability often requires sacrifice of short-term welfare. With respect to deterioration and loss of productivity of natural vegetation, a co-ordinated approach is needed towards establishing a comprehensive inventory of the condition of national vegetation resources on a geographically and scientifically sound basis.},

We examine some of the ways in which the potential violation of these assumptions can lead us into significant theoretical and methodological error. Illustrations of alternative models of research already extant within Psychology are used to explore methods of research less mean-dependent and suggest that a critical assessment of the assumptions underlying its use in research play a more explicit role in the process of study design and review.},

  abstract = {Many studies on the coexistence of wildlife with livestock have focused primarily on similar-sized species. Furthermore, many of these studies have used dietary overlap as a measure of potential competition between interacting species and thus lack the important link between dietary overlap and any negative effects on a particular species–a prerequisite for competition. Consequently, the mechanisms that drive interspecific interactions between wildlife and cattle are frequently overlooked. To address this, we used an experimental setup where we leveraged different cattle stocking rates across two seasons to identify the drivers of interspecific interactions (i.e. competition and facilitation) between smaller-bodied oribi antelope and cattle. Using direct foraging observations, we assessed dietary overlap and grass regrowth, and also calculated oribi nutritional intake rates. Ultimately, we found that cattle compete with, and facilitate, smaller-bodied oribi antelope through bottom-up control. Specifically, cattle facilitated oribi during the wet season, irrespective of cattle stocking density, because cattle foraging produced high-quality grass regrowth. In contrast, during the dry season, cattle and oribi did not co-exist in the same areas (i.e. no direct dietary overlap). Despite this, we found that cattle foraging at high densities during the previous wet season reduced the dry season availability of oribi’s preferred grass species. To compensate, oribi expanded their dry season diet breadth and included less palatable grass species, ultimately reducing their nutritional intake rates. Thus, cattle competed with oribi through a delayed, across-season habitat modification. We show that differences in body size alone may not be able to offset competitive interactions between cattle and wildlife. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that drive facilitation and competition are key to promoting co-existence between cattle and wildlife.},

  abstract = {Growing wolf (Canis lupus L.) populations in the US Rocky Mountain Region have increased conflicts between livestock production and wolf conservation. Given that the costs of large carnivore conservation are disproportionately borne by local livestock producers, the United States uses compensation for wolf damage to reduce conflicts and mediate negative attitudes toward the predators. Current compensation programs, however, only consider the direct effects of wolf predation. Indirect effects, such as wolf effects on weaning weights, and conception rates, may also reduce profitability. By not including indirect wolf effects, compensation programs may systematically undercompensate ranchers. We use a stochastic budget model of a representative cow–calf ranch in northwest Wyoming to estimate the economic impact of both direct (death loss and injured calves) and indirect effects (decreased weaning weights, decreased conception rates, and increased cattle sickness) of wolf predation. Our results suggest that short-run (i.e., year-to-year) financial impacts of wolf indirect effects may be as large as or larger than the direct effects. Including indirect effects implies that the compensation ratio (i.e., number of calves compensated per confirmed depredation) necessary to fully offset the financial impacts of wolves would need to be two to three times larger than current 7:1 compensation ratio used in Wyoming.},

  abstract = {We examined dietary niches of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), North American elk (Cervus elaphus), and free-ranging cattle (Bos taurus) that frequently co-occur in western North America. We tested the hypothesis that those three species would exhibit little overlap in diet and that mule deer, the smallest in body size of the three species, would forage more selectively than either elk or cattle. We determined diet composition from microhistological analysis and used principal components analysis to assess dietary niches. In addition to those conventional methods, we also assessed whether dietary overlap among those three ruminants would be reflected in stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) from fecal pellets. Principal component 1 represented a foraging axis based on plant classes, whereas principal component 2 represented a continuum from grazing to browsing, which revealed complete separation among those three large herbivores. Similarly, δ13C and δ15N differed significantly among species and indicated differences in moisture regimes within habitats and types of forages used by those three ruminants. Mule deer had the greatest variability in diet and foraged on more xeric forages than did either elk or cattle. Stable isotopes elucidated differences in dietary niche among the three ruminants that were not evident from dietary analysis alone.},

  abstract = {Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus), and cattle frequently co-occur on landscapes in the northwestern United States. We hypothesized that niche overlap would be greatest between introduced cattle with either of the 2 native herbivores because coevolution between native elk and mule deer should have resulted in strong patterns of resource partitioning. We observed strong differences among species in use of space, especially elevation, steepness of slope, and use of logged forests. We used 2 temporal windows to examine both immediate (6 h) and long-term (7 days) effects of competition. We noted strong avoidance over a 6-h period among the 3 ungulates. That effect was weaker for the previous 7 days. Cattle were generalists with respect to habitat selection; the 2 native herbivores avoided areas used by cattle. Mule deer and elk avoided one another during the short temporal window (6 h), although spatial differences in habitat use often were not maintained over 7 days. Elk used lower elevations when cattle were absent and moved to higher elevations when cattle were present, indicating shifts in niche breadth and competitive displacement of elk by cattle. We demonstrated strong partitioning of resources among these 3 species, and presented evidence that competition likely has resulted in spatial displacement.},

Four rangeland vegetation sampling techniques were compared to see how well they captured local plant diversity. The methods tested included the commonly used Parker transects, Daubenmire transects as modified by the USDA Forest Service, a new transect and "large quadrat" design proposed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the Modified-Whittaker multi-scale vegetation plot. The 4 methods were superimposed in shortgrass steppe, mixed grass prairie, northern mixed prairie, and tallgrass prairie in the Central Grasslands of the United States with 4 replicates in each prairie type. Analysis of variance tests showed significant method effects and prairie type effects, but no significant method X type interactions for total species richness, the number of native species, the number of species with less than 1\% cover, and the time required for sampling. The methods behaved similarly in each prairie type under a wide variety of grazing regimes. The Parker, large quadrat, and Daubenmire transects significantly underestimated the total species richness and the number of native species in each prairie type, and the number of species with less than 1\% cover in all but the tallgrass prairie type. The transect techniques also consistently missed half the exotic species, including noxious weeds, in each prairie type. The Modified-Whittaker method, which included an exhaustive search for plant species in a 20 x 50 m plot, served as the baseline for species richness comparisons. For all prairie types, the Modified-Whittaker plot captured an average of 42.9 (+/- 2.4; 1 S.E.) plant species per site compared to 15.9 (+/- 1.3), 18.9 (+/- 1.2), and 22.8 (+/- 1.6) plant species per site using the Parker, large quadrat, and Daubenmire transect methods, respectively. The 4 methods captured most of the dominant species at each site and thus produced similar results for total foliar cover and soil cover. The detection and measurement of exotic plant species were greatly enhanced by using ten 1 m2 subplots in a multi-scale sampling design and searching a larger area (1,000 m2) at each site. Even with 4 replicate sites, the transect methods usually captured, and thus would monitor, 36 to 66\% of the plant species at each site. To evaluate the status and trends of common, rare, and exotic plant species at local, regional, and national scales, innovative, multi-scale methods must replace the commonly used transect methods of the past.},

  abstract = {Populus–Salix forests are a valued riparian vegetation type in western North America. These pioneer, obligate phreatophytes have declined on some rivers, raising conservation concerns and stimulating restoration plantings, but have increased on others. Understanding patterns and causes of forest change is essential for formulating conservation, restoration and management plans. Our goal was to assess spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation change on the Upper San Pedro River in semiarid Arizona, USA, one of the few undammed rivers in the region. Over 100 years ago, intense floods initiated channel incision and substantially altered hydrogeomorphology. Pioneer trees began to establish in the widening post-entrenchment zone as the surfaces began to stabilize. Using a time-series of aerial photographs (1955–2003) we quantified recent change in area of riparian cover types. Analysis indicated that wooded area in the post-entrenchment zone nearly tripled from 1955 to 2003, at the expense of bare ground, and the active channel narrowed appreciably. This forest expansion represents a long-term response to river entrenchment, with the temporal pattern influenced by recent flood cycles and biogeomorphic feedbacks. Populus–Salix have established episodically during the infrequent years with high winter flood runoff, sequentially filling available recruitment space. Older cohorts cover wide swaths of the floodplain while young trees form narrow bands lining the channel. Barring extreme flooding, the pioneer forests are expected to senesce over the coming century. An additional factor that has shaped the pattern of post-entrenchment forest expansion is anthropogenic water withdrawal. Populus–Salix forest increase has been greatest within a conservation area, where stream flows are largely perennial. In drier, agricultural sectors, Populus–Salix have declined while the more deeply-rooted Tamarix has increased. Overall, the study reveals that long-term fluctuations in pioneer forest area and age structure are common on dryland rivers, and shows how past events such as extreme floods can interact with recent environmental practices such as freshwater withdrawal to influence riparian forest patterns. This underscores the necessity of a long-term perspective for forest conservation and management.},

  abstract = {Maintaining or enhancing the productive capacity and resilience of rangeland ecosystems is critical for the continued support of people who depend on them for their livelihoods, especially in the face of climatic change. This is also necessary for the continued delivery of ecosystem services derived from rangelands for the broader benefit of societies around the world. Multi-paddock grazing management has been recommended since the mid-20th century as an important tool to adaptively manage rangelands ecosystems to sustain productivity and improve animal management. Moreover, there is much anecdotal evidence from producers that, if applied appropriately, multi-paddock grazing can improve forage and livestock production. By contrast, recent reviews of published rangeland-based grazing systems studies have concluded that, in general, field trials show no superiority of vegetation or animal production in multi-paddock grazing relative to continuous yearlong stocking of single-paddock livestock production systems. Our goal is to provide a framework for rangeland management decisions that support the productivity and resiliency of rangelands and then to identify why different perceptions exist among rangeland managers who have effectively used multi-paddock grazing systems and research scientists who have studied them. First, we discuss the ecology of grazed ecosystems under free-ranging herbivores and under single-paddock fenced conditions. Second, we identify five principles underpinning the adaptive management actions used by successful grazing managers and the ecological, physiological, and behavioral framework they use to achieve desired conservation, production, and financial goals. Third, we examine adaptive management principles needed to successfully manage rangelands subjected to varying environmental conditions. Fourth, we describe the differences between the interpretation of results of grazing systems research reported in the scientific literature and the results reported by successful grazing managers; we highlight the shortcomings of most of the previously conducted grazing systems research for providing information relevant for rangeland managers who aim to achieve desired environmental and economic goals. Finally, we outline knowledge gaps and present testable hypotheses to broaden our understanding of how planned multi-paddock grazing management can be used at the ranching enterprise scale to facilitate the adaptive management of rangelands under dynamic environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {•We used photography-based grid point intercept (GPI) analysis and Daubenmire to assess ecosystem services in high-shrub rangelands.•Cover estimates were higher for some functional groups when using Daubenmire, likely because Daubenmire frames were situated below the shrub canopy and thus included subcanopy cover, whereas GPI photographs taken above the canopy could not eliminate shrubs that obscured subcanopy attributes.•Choice of methods affected assessment of two ecosystem services: sage-grouse habitat quality and site biodiversity; each was higher when using Daubenmire.•Understanding cover-estimate differences that stem from using GPI photo plots versus Daubenmire will allow practitioners to decide if GPI methods address project objectives. Accurate and timely spatial predictions of vegetation cover from remote imagery are an important data source for natural resource management. High-quality in situ data are needed to develop and validate these products. Point-intercept sampling techniques are a common method for obtaining quantitative information on vegetation cover that have been widely implemented in a number of local and national monitoring programs. The use of point-intercept data in remote sensing projects, however, is complicated due to differences in how vegetation cover indicators can be calculated. Decisions on whether to use plant intercepts from any canopy layer (i.e., any-hit cover) or only the first plant intercept at each point (i.e., top-hit cover) can result in discrepancies in cover estimates which are used to train remotely-sensed imagery. Our objective in this paper was to explore the theory of point-intercept sampling relative to training and testing remotely-sensed imagery, and to test the strength of relationships between top-hit and any-hit methods of calculating vegetation cover and high-resolution satellite imagery in two study areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management in northwestern Colorado and northeastern California. We modeled top-hit and any-hit percent cover for six vegetation indicators from 5m-resolution RapidEye imagery using beta regression. Model performance was judged using normalized root mean-squared error (RMSE) from a 5-fold cross validation. Any-hit cover estimates were significantly higher (α {$<$} 0.05) than top-hit cover estimates for forbs and grasses in the White River study area, but only marginally higher in Northern California. Pseudo-R2 values for beta regression models of vegetation cover from RapidEye image information varied from 0.1525 to 0.7732 in White River and 0.2455 to 0.6085 in Northern California, with little pattern to whether any-hit or top-hit indicators produced better model fit. However, normalized RMSE was lower for any-hit cover (indicating better model performance) or minimally higher than top-hit cover for all indicators in each study area. Our results do not support the idea that top-hit cover estimates from point-intercept sampling are the most appropriate for remote sensing applications in arid and semi-arid shrub-steppe environments. In fact, having two sets of different indicators calculated from the same data may cause additional confusion in a situation where there is already considerable debate on how vegetation cover should be measured and used. Ultimately, selection of indicators to use for developing remote sensing classification or predictive models should be based first on the meaning or interpretation of the indicator in the ecosystem of interest, and second on how well the indicator performs in modeling applications. •Method comparison studies are necessary to reconcile monitoring methods that have arisen among disparate programs; however, we find that Thacker et al.’s study comparing Daubenmire frame (DF) and line-point intercept (LPI) methods for estimating vegetation cover is not adequate to support their conclusions.•Because the DF and LPI methods estimate different aspects of vegetation cover (total canopy vs. foliar cover), there should be no a priori expectation that the two techniques would produce the same results.•Thacker et al. omit critical information about their methods (sampling design, training and calibration, indicator calculations) that could have a large impact on their results and how they can be interpreted.•Differences in results between different vegetation cover measurement techniques can also be attributable to factors like observer training and calibration, plot heterogeneity and complexity, spatial distribution of vegetation, plant morphology, and plot size; thus it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from a single study.•Rather than implementing both DF and LPI techniques in sage-grouse studies as Thacker et al. recommend, effort should instead be invested in ensuring that sampling for one selected method is adequate.•Critical evaluations of vegetation measurement methods to advance the science of rangeland monitoring should be conducted and reported in a rigorous manner, provide a thorough review of previous studies, and discuss how new results contribute to existing knowledge. •Thacker et al. compared two common techniques for assessing greater sage-grouse habitat: Daubenmire quadrats and line-point intercept sampling.•Sampling only 16 Daubenmire quadrats may not have been adequate to support Thacker et al.'s assertion that line-point sampling yields higher cover values and that the two methods are not comparable.•Using data from sagebrush ecosystems in Montana, we show that mean percent cover changes depending on the number of Daubenmire quadrats sampled and that 16 Daubenmire quadrats may not be sufficient to accurately characterize sagebrush vegetation.•Assessing the appropriate sampling effort for the method and study is a crucial part of designing sampling protocols and has implications for greater sage-grouse management and conservation.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary: Monitoring changes in the utilization of forages across rangelands can be time consuming and difficult with untrained personnel. The use of real time positioning for cattle is becoming commercially available with the improvements in technology. The objective of this case study was to identify the changes in livestock social associations and spatial location at two stocking densities throughout a six-week grazing period. Both pastures used similar sized herds with 35 and 29 animals tracked with global positioning systems set at 30-min intervals. A half-weight index value was calculated for each pair of tracked cattle to determine the proportion of time that cattle were within 75 m and 500 m of each other. Throughout the study, forage utilization increased from 5 to 24\% and from 10\% to 20\% and forage mass decreased from 2601 kg ha−1 to 1828 kg ha−1 and 2343 kg ha−1 to 1904 kg ha−1, in the high stocking density pasture and low stocking density pasture, respectively. Utilization of forages throughout the trial forced cattle to disperse and travel further from water sources to find new feeds. Real-time GPS tracking has the potential to remotely detect changes in animal spatial association, identify when cows disperse, and improve recognition for the need of pasture rotation to avoid rangeland degradation. Proper grazing management of arid and semi-arid rangelands requires experienced personnel and monitoring. Applications of GPS tracking and sensor technologies could help ranchers identify livestock well-being and grazing management issues so that they can promptly respond. The objective of this case study was to evaluate temporal changes in cattle association patterns using global positioning system (GPS) tracking in pastures with different stocking densities (low stocking density [LSD] = 0.123 animals ha−1, high stocking density [HSD] = 0.417 animals ha−1) at a ranch near Prescott, Arizona. Both pastures contained similar herd sizes (135 and 130 cows, respectively). A total of 32 cows in the HSD herd and 29 cows in the LSD herd were tracked using GPS collars at location fixes of 30 min during a 6-week trial in the summer of 2019. A half-weight index (HWI) value was calculated for each pair of GPS-tracked cattle (i.e., dyads) to determine the proportion of time that cattle were within 75 m and 500 m of each other. Forage mass of both pastures were relatively similar at the beginning of the study and forage utilization increased from 5 to 24\% in the HSD pasture and increased from 10 to 20\% in the LSD pasture. Cattle in both pastures exhibited relatively low mean association values (HWI {$<$} 0.25) at both spatial scales. Near the end of the study, cattle began to disperse likely in search of forages (p {$<$} 0.01) and travelled farther (p {$<$} 0.01) from water than during earlier periods. Real-time GPS tracking has the potential to remotely detect changes in animal spatial association (e.g., HWI), and identify when cows disperse, likely searching for forage.},

  abstract = {Foraging niche overlap among Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus), and cattle (Bos taurus) was studied for 2 years on 37 000 ha of nonforested foothill and mountain habitat in northwestern Wyoming. Microhistological analysis was used to quantify botanical composition of ungulate diets from monthly fecal collections. Feeding habitat use was determined through monthly surveys from fixed-wing aircraft to record nonsolitary animals in nonforested habitat. Kulcyznski’s similarity index was used to calculate dietary and feeding habitat overlap among the 3 ungulates, and these 2 indices were multiplied together to estimate foraging niche overlap. In all seasons, elk and cattle consumed grass-dominated diets (mean = 61\% and 81\%, respectively), although elk diets were more diverse. Mule deer consumed more forbs and shrubs than either elk or cattle (P {$<$} 0.10). Foraging niche overlap was high (45\%) between mule deer and elk in spring. Cattle in summer and fall had ≥60\% foraging niche overlap with elk in spring, indicating that, in spring, elk foraged in many of the same places (largely sagebrush grassland) and ate diets similar in botanical composition to what cattle did during summer and fall (principally Festuca idahoensis, Pseudoroegneria spicata, and Achnatherum spp.). Foraging niche overlap also was high (41\%–51\%) between elk in winter and cattle in summer and fall. Therefore, if competitive or complementary relationships existed between elk and cattle, these interactions most likely occurred on sagebrush grasslands where cattle use in summer–fall was followed by elk use in winter–spring. We recommend that resource managers focus their forage utilization and range trend monitoring in foothill sagebrush grasslands. Resumen Se estudió el traslape del nicho de forrajeo entre el alce de las Montañas Rocallosas, (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), el venado mula de las Montañas Rocallosas (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) y el ganado (Bos taurus); el estudio se condujo por dos años en 37 000 ha de hábitats deforestado al pie de montaña y montañoso situados en el noroeste de Wyoming. La composición botánica de la dieta de los ungulados se determinó a partir de muestras fecales colectadas mensualmente y con el uso del análisis microhistológico. El uso de hábitat alimenticio se determinó a través de muestreos mensuales por medio de un dispositivo aéreo de alas fijas para registrar los animales no solitarios en el hábitat deforestado. El índice de similaridad de Kulcyznski se uso para calcular el traslape de la dieta y del hábitat alimenticio entre los tres ungulados, y estos dos índices se multiplicaron para estimar el traslape del nicho de forrajeo. En todas las épocas de año, el alce y el ganado consumieron dietas dominadas por zacates (media = 61\% y 81\%, respectivamente), aunque las dietas del alce fueron más diversas. El venado mula consumió más hierbas y arbustos que el alce y el ganado (P {$<$} 0.10). En primavera, el traslape del nicho de forrajeo fue alto (45\%) entre el venado mula y el alce. En verano y otoño, el ganado tuvo un traslape del nicho de forrajeo ≥60\% con el alce, indicando que en primavera, el alce forrajeó en muchos de los mismos lugares (principalmente pastizal de “Sagebrush”) y comió dietas similares en composición botánica a las del ganado en verano y otoño (principalmente (principalmente Festuca idahoensis, Achnatherum spp. y Pseudoroegneria spicata). El traslape del nicho de forrajeo también fue alto (41\%–51\%) entre el alce en invierno y el ganado en verano y otoño. Por lo tanto, si existieron relaciones competitivas o complementarias entre el alce y el ganado, estas interacciones ocurrieron más probablemente en los pastizales de “Sagebrush,” donde el uso por el ganado en verano–otoño es seguido por el uso del alce en invierno–primavera. Recomendamos que los manejadores de los recursos enfoquen sus monitoreos de utilización de forraje y tendencia del pastizal en los pastizales de “Sagebrush.”.},

  abstract = {A virtual fence can be defined as a structure serving as an enclosure, a barrier, or a boundary without a physical barrier. The concept of virtual fencing occurs increasingly in discussions wherever free-ranging livestock is managed. It is especially interesting because of its potential to initially enhance ecological management, improve management by turning manual labour into cognitive labour as well as improve the life-style of livestock managers. All of these have the potential to reduce costs. Moreover, it opens up the possibility of managing areas that are not manageable at the moment. Therefore, a patent and literature search was conducted to investigate what virtual fencing involves, what opportunities there are for implementing it and what issues still need to be tackled. It was found that there are many different approaches in the development of virtual fencing, which can be split into three categories: first, to contain animals in a defined area or keep them out of a defined area using devices that are animal-borne; second, to contain animals without mounting a device onto the animal; and third, keeping animals apart with a moving fence line or using a virtual fence as a remote gathering device. The first two categories deal with static control of livestock, whereas the third category could be described as a control within moving boundaries. However, despite many patents having been found, only very few products are available on the market.},

  abstract = {Global positioning systems (GPSs) enable continuous and automatic tracking of an animal’s position. The value of such spatial–temporal information can be improved if the corresponding activity of the animal is known. We evaluated the potential of Lotek GPS collars to predict activity of beef cattle on extensive rangeland in 2 contrasting foraging environments. Collars were configured to record animal location at intervals of 20 minutes (United States) or 5 minutes (Israel), together with counts from 2 motion sensors. Synchronized field observations of collared cows were conducted in 1999 (United States) and in 2002 and 2003 (Israel). Grazing, traveling (without grazing), and resting activities were recorded as minutes out of 20 for each category (United States), or as a single category (Israel). For the US data, stepwise regression models of grazing, traveling, and resting time accounted for 74\%–84\% of the variation, on the basis of the motion sensor counts for the left–right axis and the distances between GPS fixes. Regression tree analysis of grazing time yielded a simple model (4 splits) that accounted for 85\% of the variation. For the Israeli data, the misclassification rates obtained by discriminant analysis and classification tree analysis of animal activity were 14\% and 12\%, respectively. In both analyses, almost all grazing observations were correctly classified, but other activities were sometimes misclassified as grazing. Distance alone is a poor indicator of animal activity, but grazing, traveling, and resting activities of free-ranging cattle can be inferred with reasonable accuracy from data provided by Lotek GPS collars. Resumen Los sistemas de posicionamiento global (GPS) permiten el rastreo continuo y automático de la posición de un animal. El valor de tal información espacial-temporal pueden ser mejorado si la actividad correspondiente del animal es conocida. Evaluamos el potencial de los collares de GPS Lotek para predecir la actividad del ganado para carne en un pastizal extensivo en dos ambientes de forrajeo contrastantes. Los collares fueron configurados para registrar la ubicación del animal a intervalos de 20min (US) o 5min (Israel), junto con conteos de dos sensores de movimiento. En 1999 (US), 2001 y 2002 (Israel) se condujeron observaciones de campo sincronizadas de las vacas con collar. Se registraron actividades de apacentamiento, viaje (sin apacentamiento) y descanso en términos de minutos dedicados a cada actividad dentro del período de 20 minutos (US) o como una sola categoría (Israel). Para los datos de US, los modelos de regresión a pasos para apacentamiento, viaje y tiempo de descanso explicaron de 74-84\% de la variación, basados en los conteos del sensor de movimiento para los ejes derecho-izquierdo y las distancias entre las determinaciones del GPS. El análisis de regresión de árbol del tiempo de apacentamiento produjo un modelo simple (cuatro divisiones) que explicaron el 85\% de la variación. Para los datos de Israel, las tasas de clasificación errónea obtenidas por el análisis discriminante y el análisis de clasificación de árbol fueron 14\% y 12\% respectivamente. En ambos análisis, casi todas las observaciones de apacentamiento fueron clasificadas correctamente, pero las otras actividades algunas veces fueron clasificadas erróneamente como apacentamiento. La distancia sola es un indicador pobre de la actividad animal, pero las actividades de apacentamiento, viaje y descanso del ganado en libre apacentamiento pueden ser inferidas con una certeza razonable a partir de datos provenientes de collares de GPS Lotek.},

  abstract = {The widespread replacement of wild ungulate herbivores by domestic livestock in African savannas is composed of two interrelated phenomena: (1) loss or reduction in numbers of individual wildlife species or guilds and (2) addition of livestock to the system. Each can have important implications for plant community dynamics. Yet very few studies have experimentally addressed the individual, combined, and potentially interactive effects of wild vs. domestic herbivore species on herbaceous plant communities within a single system. Additionally, there is little information about whether, and in which contexts, livestock might functionally replace native herbivore wildlife or, alternatively, have fundamentally different effects on plant species composition. The Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment, which has been running since 1995, is composed of six treatment combinations of mega-herbivores, meso-herbivore ungulate wildlife, and cattle. We sampled herbaceous vegetation 25 times between 1999 and 2013. We used partial redundancy analysis and linear mixed models to assess effects of herbivore treatments on overall plant community composition and key plant species. Plant communities in the six different herbivore treatments shifted directionally over time and diverged from each other substantially by 2013. Plant community composition was strongly related (R2 = 0.92) to residual plant biomass, a measure of herbivore utilization. Addition of any single herbivore type (cattle, wildlife, or mega-herbivores) caused a shift in plant community composition that was proportional to its removal of plant biomass. These results suggest that overall herbivory pressure, rather than herbivore type or complex interactions among different herbivore types, was the main driver of changes in plant community composition. Individual plant species, however, did respond most strongly to either wild ungulates or cattle. Although these results suggest considerable functional similarity between a suite of native wild herbivores (which included grazers, browsers, and mixed feeders) and cattle (mostly grazers) with respect to understory plant community composition, responses of individual plant species demonstrate that at the plant-population-level impacts of a single livestock species are not functionally identical to those of a diverse group of native herbivores.},

  abstract = {1. Through their effects on plant communities, herbivores can exert strong direct and indirect effects on savanna ecosystems and have the potential to create and maintain savanna landscape heterogeneity. Throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, periodic creation and abandonment of livestock corrals leads to landscape mosaics of long-term ecosystem hotspots that attract both cattle and large ungulate wildlife. 2. The development and maintenance of vegetation in these types of hotspots may be controlled in part by herbivory. Cattle and wildlife may have different, potentially contrasting effects on plant succession and plant–plant interactions. We ask how cattle and wild herbivores affect the maintenance and vegetation development of corral-derived landscape heterogeneity (0.25–1.0 ha treeless ‘glades’) in Laikipia, Kenya, through their effects on long-term successional and short-term plant–plant dynamics. 3. We used the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment to exclude from glades different combinations of cattle, large ungulate wildlife (i.e. zebras, gazelles and other antelopes), and mega-herbivore wildlife (i.e. giraffes and elephants). We first assessed long-term changes in cover of the dominant grass species, Cynodon plectostachyus and Pennisetum stramineum (the early- and late-dominant species, respectively). We then used a neighbour removal experiment to test the effects of different herbivores on competition and facilitation between the two glade grass species. 4. In the long-term experiment, we found that large ungulate wildlife reinforced landscape heterogeneity over time by helping maintain glades in their early C. plectostachyus-dominated form. Cattle and mega-herbivore wildlife, on the other hand, appeared to reduce the positive effects through forage preference for C. plectostachyus. 5. In the neighbour removal experiment, we found that each grass species benefited from facilitation when it was the preferred forage for the dominant grazer. Facilitation of C. plectostachyus by P. stramineum was strongest when cattle co-occurred with wildlife, whereas facilitation of P. stramineum by C. plectostachyus was strongest when cattle were absent. 6. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that different combinations of cattle and wildlife have different effects, largely via contrasting forage preferences, on the persistence of landscape heterogeneity in this savanna landscape. More generally, we provide evidence for contrasting effects of cattle and wildlife on short-term plant interactions (facilitation) and successional processes within the herbaceous plant community.},

  abstract = {Free-roaming horses (Equus ferus caballus) occur throughout arid and semiarid regions of the western United States, where they can decrease plant biomass and diversity, impair water quality, and reduce forage available to native wildlife and domestic livestock. Management of free-roaming horses on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and US Forest Service lands is determined by protections and population targets established by law, but these do not apply to other federal or Tribal Lands, where relatively little is known about the abundance and distribution of free-roaming horses. To address this information gap, we conducted the first comprehensive survey of free-roaming horses within the Navajo Nation, which is the largest Tribal Land holding in the contiguous United States and covers portions of the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. We used stratified random sampling and double-observer distance methods to produce estimates of horse abundance corrected for detection bias. During the summer of 2016, we used fixed-wing aircraft to survey 4 975 km of transects across our 67 089-km2 study area. We observed 4 290 horses distributed among 527 groups and estimated 38 223 horses lived within the study area during the survey period (standard of error [SE]: 6 052, 90\% confidence interval: 29 365–47 080), with 29 394 horses in open areas (SE: 5 511, 90\% confidence interval [CI]: 21 328–37 460) and 8 829 horses in forested areas (SE: 2 331, 90\% CI: 5 417–12 240). Overall density of 0.570 horses/km2 (SE: 0.090, 90\% CI: 0.438–0.702) was 23\% higher than density of horses and burros (Equus asinus) in all BLM herd management areas (HMAs) in 2016 and exceeded by 17\% the density in Nevada, the only state with an HMA of comparable size to the Navajo Nation. Our results will inform management of a free-roaming horse population that this study has revealed to be the among the largest in the United States.},

Reduced apex predator occupancy or activity can release mesopredators from intraguild competition, with unknown repercussions on the ecological community. As exurban development continues to expand worldwide, it is important to document how mesopredators are impacted by the combined influences of apex predators and humans. We used motion-detecting camera traps to examine spatial and temporal patterns of meso- and apex predator occupancy and activity in a fragmented landscape in California. We hypothesized that both spatial and temporal partitioning among the carnivore guild would be affected by varied levels of human influence. We found that higher residential development reduced puma occupancy but was not related to the occupancy of mesopredators. Bobcats, grey foxes, and Virginia opossums were detected more often at sites occupied by pumas, whereas coyotes and raccoons were detected less often. The detection probabilities of smaller mesopredators were related to coyotes, a dominant mesopredator, but the magnitude and direction of these correlations differed depending upon puma occupancy. We also found that species altered their activities temporally in locations with higher human use, with pumas, bobcats and coyotes reducing diurnal activities and increasing nocturnal ones. These activity shifts were reflected in reduced temporal partitioning between intraguild competitors, with unknown effects on species interactions and repercussions to the prey community. Our results suggest that human development and activity alters predator community structure through both direct and indirect pathways. Therefore effective carnivore conservation requires an understanding of how mesopredators respond to varying levels of apex predator and anthropogenic influences.},

  abstract = {Program MARK provides {$>$}100 models for the estimation of population parameters from mark-encounter data. The multistate model of Brownie et al. (1993) and Hestbeck et al. (1991) allows animals to move between states with a probability of transition. The simplest multistate model is an extension of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) live recapture model. Parameters estimated are state-specific survival rates and encounter probabilities and transition probabilities between states. The multistate model provides a valuable framework to evaluate important ecological questions. For example, estimation of state-specific survival and transition probabilities between the biological states of breeders and nonbreeders allows estimation of the cost of reproduction. Transitions between physical states, such as spatial areas, provide estimates needed for meta-population models. The basic multistate model uses only live recaptures, but 3 extensions are included in MARK. A multistate model with live and dead encounters is available, although the dead encounters are not state specific. Robust-design multistate models are also included in MARK, with both open and closed robust designs. These models assume that animals move between states only between primary sessions of the robust design. For the closed robust design, we can specify 12 different data types for the modeling of encounter probabilities during the primary session, including 6 versions of the closed model likelihood incorporating population size (N) directly in the likelihood, and 6 versions of the Huggins model in which N is estimated as a derived parameter outside the likelihood. One assumption that is generally necessary to estimate state-specific survival rates in the multistate model is that transitions take place immediately before encounter occasions. Otherwise, survival rates over the interval between encounter occasions are a mix of survival rates over multiple states. Advantages of using MARK to estimate the parameters of the various multistate models include flexibility of model specification to include group, time, and individual covariates, estimation of variance components, model averaging of parameter estimates, and Bayesian parameter estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures on the logit scale.},

  abstract = {Rangelands of the western Great Plains of North America are complex social-ecological systems where management objectives for livestock production, grassland bird conservation, and vegetation structure and composition converge. The Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management (CARM) experiment is a 10-year collaborative adaptive management (CAM) project initiated in 2012 that is aimed at fostering science-management partnerships and data-driven rangeland management through a participatory, multistakeholder approach. This study evaluates the decision-making process that emerged from the first 4 yr of CARM. Our objectives were to 1) document how diverse stakeholder experiences, epistemologies, and resulting knowledge contributed to the CARM project, 2) evaluate how coproduced knowledge informed management decision making through three grazing seasons, and 3) explore the implications of participation in the CARM project for rangeland stakeholders. We evaluated management decision making as representatives from government agencies and conservation nongovernmental organizations, ranchers, and interdisciplinary researchers worked within the CARM experiment to 1) prioritize desired ecosystem services; 2) determine objectives; 3) set stocking rates, criteria for livestock movement among pastures, and vegetation treatments; and 4) select monitoring techniques that would inform decision making. For this paper, we analyzed meeting transcripts, interviews, and focus group data related to stakeholder group decision making. We find two key lessons from the CARM project. First, the CAM process makes visible, but does not reconcile differences between, stakeholder experiences and ways of knowing about complex rangeland systems. Second, social learning in CAM is contingent on the development of trust among stakeholder and researcher groups. We suggest future CAM efforts should 1) make direct efforts to share and acknowledge managers’ different rangeland management experiences, epistemologies, and knowledge and 2) involve long-term research commitment in time and funding to social, as well as experimental, processes that promote trust building among stakeholders and researchers over time.},

  abstract = {Aim: To clarify the concepts and terms that have been used in recording plant canopies and the methods used for measuring them. Concepts: The concepts considered are coven top cover, repeated cover, number of layers, proportion of repeated cover and leaf area index (LAI). Variants include canopy cover, basal area and leaf area density. Other terms have been used in the past, some are now ambiguous and some are counter-intuitive. Measurement: Cover and its related concepts can be measured by point intercept, line intercept, angle sampling, charting and image analysis, canopy transmittance, complete enumeration, clipping and allometry. The common procedure of adding the cover of individual species to calculate a "total cover" is invalid: a nonsense number is produced. Other measures of abundance: Cover-abundance, density, frequency, biomass and calorific values can also be used to measure abundance. They are related to cover. Especially, shoot frequency at a point is cover (the point intercept method). Subjective estimates: There are severe problems with cover-abundance scales, such as that of Braun-Blanquet. Estimation of abundance "by eye", by "informed guess", etc. has too often compromised results in vegetation science.},

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Mean incidence of pregnancy among mares ≥2 years old in composite samples from Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming was 57.0, 61.0, and 81.4\%, respectively. Pregnancy rates did not differ significantly between lactating and non-lactating mares. Pregnancies among yearling mares were confirmed by rectal palpation and lactation rates of 22.2 and 11.9\% among 2-year-old animals in Nevada and Wyoming, respectively. Agreement between pregnancy rates of 37 burros estimated by rectal palpation and PROG levels (≥2.00 ng/mL) was 73.0\%. Mean apparent incidence of pregnancy in burros ≥2 years old was 72.3\%; 25\% of the yearlings were pregnant.}

  abstract = {Soil or sediment redistribution prediction along hillslopes and within small watersheds is considered to be a great challenge for the application of watershed erosion models in predicting the impact of soil and water conservation measures as well as for the redistribution of pollution such as radioactive fallout. In this study, long-term soil loss and deposition were estimated for two nested semi-arid watersheds within the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Southeastern Arizona using the process-based Geo-spatial interface of WEPP (GeoWEPP). While soil parameters were previously parametrized and validated through watershed outlet runoff and sediment yields, the channel parameters were adjusted and validated based on reference values of soil redistribution generated from fallout radionuclide 137Cs samples within the watersheds. Two methods were applied for the soil redistribution analysis by comparing observed and simulated soil loss/deposition rates (a) at single pixels and reference values at the specific location of each 137Cs sample site; and (b) for average values of a 5 m radius around each 137Cs sample site to compensate for measurement and model uncertainties. Surprisingly, soil redistribution predictions improved as topographic data resolution increased from 5 m to 3 m and were best at 1 m without changing key model parameters that were originally derived at the watershed scale.},
