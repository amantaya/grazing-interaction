# 2022-06-28-15-57-12 Idea for Automatically Removoing Assignments from Box
Created: 2022-06-28 15:57:12

Once a sorting/scoring assignment is marked as completed on Basecamp, we need to remove that folder from Box. 

I could write an R script that matches the string from the completed assignment (using regex) with the folder name on Box, and then deletes the folder from Box. #idea #💡 #heberproject
